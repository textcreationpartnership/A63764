            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> More fear the cenſures of thoſe that ſhall read but part of this diſcourſe, or take their eſtimate concerning the import of it at the ſecond hand, from the repreſentation of the Ignorant, or deeply prae-engaged Learned; than an attempted confutation of any deliberate Oppoſer; yet I promiſe my ſelf exemption from neither.</p>
            <p>I pretend not here to teach new Divinity. The things here maintained, that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſtrange, are not ſo remote from the common ſentiments of men, as the moſt will ſuppoſe, being but the opinions, or the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequences of ſuch opinions, as the moſt moderate men have, at leaſt virtually, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and maintained; though I cannot deny but many of them, being not well conſiſtent
<pb facs="tcp:105933:3"/>

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:105933:4"/>with themſelves, have alſo maintained the contrary; not that I hereby accuſe any: for this is only a not denying ſuch, while good Chriſtians, to be, in this particular, ill Logicians.</p>
            <p>That no man is juſtly bound by any Law of God, or man, any further than his natural faculties and power reach, is written with indelible Characters on every man's Soul as legibly, as that there is ſuch a thing as juſtice or injuſtice.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, That a man is bound by the Law of God (what ever ſome ſay to the contrary) ſo far; ſo that his greateſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or averſation of will to obey it, will not excuſe him, but really add to his inexcuſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; is as legible as that the greateſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wickedneſs, and doth not excuſe. And he that will deny this, may with as much reaſon deny the moral laudability of Chriſt's obedience on Earth, or an Angel's in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe of their morally inſuperable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of Will to ſuch obedience; whereas ſuch obedience is more laudable, as having more of the Will.</p>
            <p>Yet thirdly, ſuch wickedneſs, or averſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Will to good, will as certainly, as what is moſt certain, hinder (elſe you muſt ſay, Man's wickedneſs is no hindrance, or ſo little a hindrance of his obedience, that he hath no need of the grace of the Hole Spirit to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it) I ſay, will moſt certainly hinder
<pb facs="tcp:105933:4"/>man's complyance with the divine commands, till God ſhall take away, or overcome ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy of will by ſome ſuch ſuperffluence of Grace, as he is not bound in juſtice to afford them, or hold them excuſed. For God is bound in juſtice to do no more for men in order to the making them obedient to his Laws, or elſe to hold them excuſed for not being obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; than ſo much as would render their not obeying his Laws culpable and inexcuſable, if men were not wicked, or had no averſation of will to ſuch obedience.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe three poſitions by evident conſequence follows, (ſuppoſing you will allow men to have any culpable or ſinful Impotency on them; which he that denyes, muſt affirm, that men can, for any Impotency on them whatſoever, ſo order their Converſations, as not to need Chriſt's death or pardon for their failings therein; And may alſo, with as much ſhew of reaſon, either deny, that it can, in any ſenſe, be ſaid truly, That Chriſt could not ſin, or Angels in Heaven cannot ſin, or God cannot ſin, or lye; or elſe deny that this their morally inſuperable rectitude or holineſs of will was or is Morally commendable) I ſay, it hence follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> That man's culpable Impotency lieth only in an Impotency, to do what he hath a power to do, or (to ſpeak the ſame in other words) in Man's not being able to do in one ſenſe, what he can do in another ſenſe. And
<pb facs="tcp:105933:5"/>to ſay otherwiſe, is to forget, that Morality ſuppoſeth, and is ſubjected in a naturally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> in a rational Being, or a being indued with the power or faculty of free Will; And conſequently that a Moral or culpable Cannot-obey, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth, and is ſubjected in natural power to obey; and a Moral or laudable Cannot ſin, in a Natural power to ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> That the effect of the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, lyeth not in man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from God the meer power to obey God's Commands: Since, Firſt, This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is due in juſtice, ſuppoſing he require o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from men, and therefore is not from Grace (The Law ſuppoſes this, or it could not be a Law, becauſe not obligatory to a man wanting ſuch power.) And Secondly; Man could not ſin, or be guilty, or inexcuſable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this power, in not doing what the command requires; whereas men can ſin without this Grace; elſe why do any pray for it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others to keep them from ſin.</p>
            <p>But the effect of this Grace lyeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from God ſomthing over and beſide this power, to cauſe a man to do what he is bound to do, and would be too blame for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and therefore conſequently had a power to do it, though this Grace had been denyed him.</p>
            <p>Me thinks theſe things are ſo clear, that it would be a reproach, not only to Learning,
<pb facs="tcp:105933:5"/>but to humanity, if any, eſpecially of many Learned men, ſhould be found ſeriouſly to hold the contrary.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, that this diſtinction of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Moral impotency,</hi> is of ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Divinity, that they that ſhall ſpeak, of the Controverſies hereby endeavoured to be cleared without keeping clear Notions about this diſtinction, ſhall (though otherwiſe learned Fathers and Doctors) ſpeak like Children concerning them; And alſo that men of ordinary underſtandings, keeping to this diſtinction, may competently ſatisfy themſelves and others, if willing to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in ſuch Controverſies as have poſed the greateſt wits and Shollars, that keep not to it.</p>
            <p>I look upon St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> humour as much obſtructing the increaſe of knowledg; who endeavoured to diſcourage attempts againſt his writings, by telling* <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt,<note n="†" place="margin">Hoc u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurcio, &amp; repetens iterum iterumque monebo, corrut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea, I ſo far diſlike it, that I hereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to ingenuous men that ſhall have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to reflect upon this diſcourſe, that I am ſo far from having, or at leaſt from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to have any ſuch offenſive weapons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, that I deſire to lye open to truth, by being naked of any armour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt it's convictions; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no great averſation to ſay, as thoſe,
<pb facs="tcp:105933:6"/>
               <hi>Judg. 19.30.</hi> once did, <hi>viz. [Conſider of it, take advice, and ſpeak your minds.]</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, men would but obſerve the commonly neglected order preſcribed in that ſpeech, by practiſing the two firſt parts of the advice, before the laſt.</p>
            <p>That this diſcourſe may be as influential to the promoting of Truth, Holineſs, and Peace amongſt us, as it is proper and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch ends, is the prayer and hearts-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Author.</p>

            <p>And again; That there is an Impotency in men to Good is apparent, not only from Scripture, as, <hi>No man can come to me, exceept &amp;c.</hi> and can the Blackmore change his skin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from the woful Experience of all; yea the Heathens<note n="†" place="margin">Plato.</note> acknowledged it, and were puzled how to give an account of its original:<note place="margin">

            <p>The Moral and Ethical act or habit is juſt contrary, It is that which is laudable or vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable, and that which a man may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as honeſt or diſhoneſt for.</p>
            <p>Now Natural Impotency is always, in this ſenſe, of ſomthing that a man cannot do if he would never ſo much; or hath not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faculty of willing it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moral Impotency</hi> is of ſomthing that a man hath the natural faculty to will, or can do it if he would; but is hindered only by moral vitious habits, from willing or doing it.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105933:8"/>
            <p>The Stoick Philoſophers uſe to expreſs this difference well, by <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Every man (though he know not how to expreſs this to others, nor poſſibly clear it to himſelf) hath a notion of theſe things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and which belong to one ſort, and which to the other; and that one is capable of a juſt command or prohibition, the other not.</p>
            <p>If any one hear of a man that abhorrs ſuch a particular meat, which is Gods good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appointed for food, he pities him, but doth not blame him; and ſo, when he hears of the man that ſo abhorred Wine, that he could not receive it in the Sacrament: But if he hear of a man that hates and abhorrs God and good men, and that cannot endure to hear any good inſtructions, he blames him; and is ſure, this is not blameleſs as the other is. But I will ſpeak more plainly, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>That Man hath, and wanteth not, a natural power of doing any duty, who hath, firſt an objective Evidence, that is intelligible, fitted and ſuited objectively to produce the Act, that he either knows, or may know what is required of him, if he make that uſe of his underſtanding, that he hath power to do.</p>
            <p>Secondly: That hath the natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of underſtanding and willing the thing commanded, and that not only in <hi>actu primo,</hi> as, we ſay Natural Fools have; but <hi>actu ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105933:9"/>i.e. without natural impediments hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their exerciſe: Here now is enough named already for all elicit Acts. <hi>viz.</hi> meer acts of the will and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Then he hath the natural power for performing the <hi>imperate</hi> acts, when there is no external or internal force, no man or thing hindering him; and hath a body rightly diſpoſed, is not deaf or blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hath the outward helps neceſſary for ſome <hi>imperate</hi> acts, as, a ſufficient eſtate to give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that he can do the <hi>imperate</hi> act if he would.</p>
            <p>This is it, Then a man hath the <hi>natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> to do any thing, when he hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties, and no hinderance but that he can do the thing if he would; And then he hath a <hi>Natural Impotency</hi> when he hath not theſe faculties, or cannot do the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, if he would never ſo much. Now I will name the Proprieties of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt; The want of this natural power, their <hi>Natural Impotency,</hi> doth excuſe, as is commonly granted; and they that deny it are not conſiſtent with themſelves, but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares grant it. Total <hi>Natural Impotency</hi> doth excuſe before God and Man: Yea all <hi>Natural Impotency</hi> doth excuſe according to the meaſure and degree of it. Some little <hi>Natural Impotency</hi> doth in ſome meaſure, though not wholly; <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à tot.</hi> It is ſome excuſe if a Servant be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a foot journey and go not, if ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105933:9"/>lame. ſo that he could not go it but with great difficulty, but if quite lame (could not at all) a full excuſe. If a man be <hi>hebeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> blockiſh, ſomthing dull, it is ſome excuſe for is not underſtanding difficulties in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which he might yet poſſibly, with great difficulty, underſtand; but if quite a Fool, ſo as to have no more uſe of Reaſon than a Beaſt; it is a total excuſe from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to learn or underſtand. Without doubt aman of dull Intellectuals, is not bound to underſtand ſuch things in Divinity, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great acuteneſs of parts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; for, he cannot if he would. And doubtleſs a command for a man to will his own miſery formally, or to nill his own happineſs formally (which all agree, No man can do) would not oblige; ſo as that a man ſhould be too blame in not doing it: ſince a man hath not the natural faculty or power to do ſuch things.</p>
            <p>If a man that is not much inclined to it, give himſelf over to ſleep in times of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, it is a great fault: If a man be very ſleepy, and ſleep at ſuch a time, it is ſome excuſe, even ſo far as it aroſe from a natural cauſe; but yet it is a fault ſo far, as it was from careleſneſs to ſtir up himſelf, from want of the awe of Gods preſence, ſo far as he might, if he would, do otherwiſe; but if it ſo ſeized on him, that his greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours could not preſerve him from it, no fault: Need <hi>I</hi> prove this? The very mention ſeems enough.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105933:10"/>
            <p>All thoſe Divines, conſulted about it, took it for granted that it was not the duty of that good man, to drink wine in the Euchariſt, that could not, if he would, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noral command did not oblige him.</p>
            <p>And all generally grant it as apparent, That the Heathens (that never had, nor could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Revelation of it) ſhall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not Believing Chriſt and his death, becauſe they had not the means that were naturally neceſſary; And by the ſame Reaſon they muſt affirm (elſe they muſt ſay That is no reaſon, and find ſome other) that they ſhall not be condemned for not doing the things they could not do, and alſo that we ſhall not be condemned for not knowing or doing the things that we cannot know or do: elſe they muſt ſay, God had greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the Heathen, than for us. There are only three Exceptions that I can call to mind, that are made by any to this general Aſſertion, with any ſhew of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome make this Exception, That if a man's natural Impotency proceed from his own fault, or his Anceſtors, ſo as to be his own fault, in Law, or reputatively; then it doth not excuſe him from obedience to the command.</p>
            <p>I think it apparent, that yet it doth excuſe; and I wil bring their own ſtrongeſt Inſtances; If a man have, by his own lewd courſes, run himſelf into debt, ſo that now he cannot pay his debts if he would; his not paying in this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105933:10"/>caſe after his diſability, ceaſeth to be a fault. He ought indeed to lament that former wickedneſs, that brought this Natural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency upon him (and to aggravate it in his Confeſſions with theſe afflictive conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, that, He cannot now pay, and, His Creditors are provoked, and God diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) for he could then have done otherwiſe; And he ought to deſire to pay, &amp; for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſolve to uſe ſuch probably means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, as that he may hereafter be inabled to pay part or all, for this he can do.</p>
            <p>But he cannot truly, when the Creditour bids him pay, and he would, but cannot, in his Confeſſions of his faults to God that day, ſay I have, to all my other ſins, added this ſin, that I did not this day pay the man when he required it. Now, ſuppoſe the Creditor had demanded it ten times in a day, there would have been ten ſeveral ſins of injuſtice in not paying him his own, if he had been able to pay it; but he cannot, when unable, <hi>lament</hi> that, over and beſides the committing thoſe ſins that diſenabled him from paying, he is guilty before God of ten new faults that day in not praying. It cannot be ſaid that a man overwhelmed in debt, through his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer defauls, and would pay but cannot, lives in known preſent omiſſion of that which is his duty: And ſo if a man have, by ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways broken his legs, or brought ſome Natural Impotency on himſelf, that he can not go to hear a Sermon, he may lament his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105933:11"/>former wickedneſs that brought that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency on him, but cannot lament it as his fault that day that he did not go to hear the Sermon: that is, he ought to lament that as his fault which he could have not done when he did it, and that is not to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as his fault, which he could not do, when he did it not.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall object, <hi>But God may puniſh theſe men?</hi> I anſwer, There can be no juſt puniſhment but for a fault; but this is no fault.</p>
            <p>God may for ever puniſh them for thoſe their faults that cauſed this Impotency: for they might have done otherwiſe, but not at all for the not doing that which they could not do.</p>
            <p>If you object. <hi>But men may puniſh the Debtor above-mentioned? Will you ſay, Laws are unjuſt that do ſo?</hi> This Objection hath greateſt ſtrength to ſilence Antagoniſts, to run them upon the prejudice of ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt wiſe Laws, and <hi>Senatus-conſulta,</hi> and <hi>Reſponſa prudentum,</hi> which are to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced. <hi>I</hi> Anſwer, the Law-makers, in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch men to lie in priſon at the will of the Creditors, do juſtly and wiſely: For, how could any be reſtrained from luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laviſhing all away with fear of Law, if when they had rendred themſelves unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible, they were to be acquitted from puniſhment. Yea, they do not unwiſely or unjuſtly (becauſe humane laws muſt be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105933:11"/>and finite, and not infinite, and taking notice of all particulars, unleſs they will make this only Law, which would be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite. To leave all to the diſcretion of Judges, which <hi>Legiſtators</hi> that have care of the Common-Weal muſt not do,) <hi>I</hi> ſay they do not unjuſtly to ſuffer men to lie in Priſon at the wil of the Creditor, where there was no fault, but the man's poverty came ſome way unexpected, and unavoidable by humane prudence; becauſe greater inconveniences would enſue in having a Law to free men from puniſhment from the Creditors, if poverty came on them without any fault. Becauſe it is an eaſie thing to conceal Eſtates, and this would unavoidably ſubject Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Will and Conſcience of their Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: whereas there is far greater reaſon that the Borrower (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) ſhould be Servant to the Lender, and in his power; than that the Lender ſhould be Servant to the Borrower and in his power: and it is more agreeable to natural equity, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Government; and the contrary would be deſtructive to the Community. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators</hi> ſuppoſe, or will and deſire, that Creditors will not keep Debtors in Priſon when unable to pay, and this diſability came on them without any former fault, as in riotous miſ-pending, but if Creditors do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they judg it would be more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the Community, to hinder them by a Law, than to leave it to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105933:12"/>But if there was a fault, whereby they came to their want, the Creditors do juſtly in keeping them in priſon (provided the puniſhment exceed not the offence) if they have reſpect to their former fault and wickedneſs in miſpending, and alſo do it to make them warnings to others that they do not ſinfully laviſh. But if any ſhould know he is unable, and yet keep his Debtor in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not with reſpect to his former fault, or to warn others; but merely in wrath and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, becauſe he doth not pay him when he knoweth he cannot, it would be ſinful and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, becauſe, ſo far, it is for no fault. But now, God will not do ſuch a thing (as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws muſt ſuffer, and ſome irrational ſinful men may do) in his immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He can infallibly diſtinguiſh where a fault is, and where none; And as he will not puniſh a man for not paying his debts, when his Poverty came on him by the hand of God, and not by his own default; ſo where his diſability to pay did come by his own ſin, he will not puniſh him for that which was no fault, as his then not paying when he could not; but for that which was his fault, his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful making himſelf unable when he could have done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The inſtance of Drunkenneſs ſeems diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be anſwered. I may here be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the Authority of thoſe that grant, All Natural Impotency doth excuſe, except that Impotency of underſtanding and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105933:12"/>will, that ariſeth from drunkenneſs; and that this is ſo far from excuſing, that it<note n="*" place="margin">

Ariſt. ad Nicom.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the fault, I ſhall, before I directly anſwer, premiſe this, (which I perceive is the greateſt Objection againſt what I ſhall ſay, and cauſeth the Miſtake of Caſuiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining otherwiſe;) Juſt and prudent, and neceſſary Laws that men ought to make, are not to over-rule our judgements here. I like well that ſaying of our Engliſh Lawyers, that, The Law will rather ſuffer a miſchief, than an Inconvenience; meaning by a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that which may fall too heavy on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man accidentally; and by Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that which would be a general Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to the whole Community; it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on them <hi>Ne quid decrimenti reſpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica caperet.</hi> It would be a miſs, could it be helped without a greater Inconvenience, to allow an injured man's teſtimony to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way another's life; yet I think it a good Law that a man's Oath againſt him that rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, is Evidence enough to a Jury; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe, whereas not one in many is apprehended, they might ſo order their Robberies, as not one in a multitude would be puniſhed So the Law of concealing a dead Baſtard-Child ſeems hard, but is neceſſary on this account. God himſelf, if he make Laws, poſſibly fit for humane Judicatures; they muſt ſubject ſome to miſchiefe in the Lawyer's ſenſe, as that of the Oath of two Witneſſes being irrefragable, which ſome innocent man might ſuffer by.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105933:13"/>
            <p>I think, <hi>Legiſlators</hi> do wiſely and juſtly in inflicting a penalty on men for doing the thing when drunk, that they would inflict if he had done it when ſober; For</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the moſt part, Men drunk have the uſe of their will and underſtanding in ſome meaſure, and ſo may at that time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by conſideration of the penalty; and they have alſo at that time the greateſt need for the moſt part to be reſtrained by the greatneſs of the penalty; And if they then knew there was no danger, or no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the penalty, the puniſhment being to be mitigated; it would ſubject the Innocent to the Luſts and rage of Drunken men.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Suppoſe, ſome may be quite mad with drink, and utterly deprived of the uſe of Reaſon, and conſequently of Will, and yet are capable of committing ſuch wicked acts (I mean materially wicked): It would be an imprudent particular Law that ſhould be made to ſpare ſuch; becauſe the moſt that commit enormities in their drink, would eſcape upon this pretence; and many would deſignedly drink to exceſs, that they might without danger, or with little danger, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, or fulfil ſome other Luſt; and they would know that the more horrid their fact was (as killing a Father) the more likely they would be to eſcape upon pretence of madneſs, as if none, but one mad, would do it</p>
            <p>Thirdly: There would yet be ſomething
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105933:13"/>of juſtice, though wholly deprived of the uſe of reaſon, becauſe the puniſhment is for the offence of Drunkenneſs, which was volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and to make other dread Drunkenneſs, eſpecially they that have in this reſpect the moſt need, that are apt to be in a rage by it, as that which may bring on them, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, Capital puniſhment. And alſo when the Law gives a man as much power to hold his neighbour to his Bargain which he made when Drunk as when Sober; partly it may be for penalty; and partly it may be for inconveniencies, that otherwiſe would follow, were the Law otherwiſe. And yet no Conſcientious man (however in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſes) would hold a man to his bargain if quite, or but almoſt, deprived of the uſe of his reaſon by his drink. But to ſpeak to the Caſe.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould, through Drunkenneſs, proceed to ſuch madneſs, as to be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the uſe of his reaſon, and ſhould then kill a man; he ought, when in his right mind, lament the ſin of making himſelf Drunk; and ought to aggravate it with ſuch Circumſtances: but he might rather look on his killing the man, as a puniſhment God ſuffered him to incur for his ſin, and as his ſorrow, rather then any diſtinct ſin; for it would not be properly and formally Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor any other ſin; becauſe not at all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary: for if there be no Underſtanding, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any thing of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105933:14"/>will, univocally &amp; properly ſo called; &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably it leſſens that particular fault, if almoſt deprived of Reaſon. Yet I dare not ſay with <hi>Auguſtine, lib.</hi> 22. <hi>Contr. Fauſt. Manic.</hi> cap. 44. <hi>Culpandus eſt</hi> Lot, non <hi>quantum ille Inceſtus in ebrietate admiſſus, ſed quantum illa ebrietas, meretur,</hi> That this, that <hi>Lot</hi> was to be blamed for his Drunkeneſs, but not for his Inceſt. Becauſe Expoſitors are not agreed of the meaning of the place; And I durſt leſs ſay it of his ſecond Inceſt: for he might be guilty of Inceſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, it not being enough againſt his will, while he had the uſe of it, if he, before his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Drunkeneſs, knew what had fallen out in the firſt, and might not improbably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the like might follow again. But I ſhould be tireſome, if I ſhould endeavour too great exactneſs. You ſee the thing, in <hi>theſi,</hi> made plain, and that is enough here. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Maſter find his Servant Drunk to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſenſeleſneſs, and then ſhould utter ſuch words as theſe, I command thee now to go immediately ſuch a Journey, would it not be irrational in the Maſter to be angry at his Servant, not only (which he may be) for making himſelf Drunk, and unfit for hearing and obeying his commands, both which he could not have done when he did them; But alſo for his not going the journey at that time when he knew he could not?</p>
            <p>Secondly; Others make this Exception, that all Natural Impotence doth excuſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105933:14"/>the man think he is able, and that he hath the Natural power to do the thing he is commanded, and then it doth not excuſe; then it is his fault not to do the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, though he cannot. The inſtance they uſe to bring is this, If a Servant be bound in his bed, that he cannot riſe, he knowing nothing of it, and his Maſter calls him, and bids him riſe; but he reſolvedly lies ſtill and will not.</p>
            <p>This is eaſily anſwered: For any one may ſee that the fault here, is not, That he did not riſe, which he could not; but that he did not will, deſire, or endeavour to riſe, which he could do.</p>
            <p>This Inſtance rather confirms what I ſay. And again, this Inſtance is very improper for the thing it is commonly brought, and as it is commonly applied; for this ſeems to take for granted, that the wicked are in no fault, in that they do not Repent and Believe; and ſo that the commands of Repenting and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving do not oblige them, but only it is their fault they do not deſire, will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do theſe: and it is to grant they may will, deſire, and endeavour to obey the Goſpel, as having no Impotency to theſe, but only cannot do the thing deſired. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I muſt deny this as pelagianiſm, and muſt ſay, that, in the ſenſe they cannot believe and obey, they cannot deſire, will, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it; and I can ſhew you that to will ſo far as to come to the prevailing choice,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105933:15"/>would be Saving. Yet theſe mean the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing degree: For when they tell men they cannot believe the Goſpel, but wiſh them do what they can, <hi>viz:</hi> Will it; they do not mean that they exhort them by this to will, to obey the Goſpel in ſuch a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſo remiſly, as yet to will prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to reject the Goſpel. This again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to make it ſenſe, That, if wicked men did know (as the Objectors ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do) that they have no Power, then it would be no fault for them to reject the Goſpel. And then it would be Miniſters duty indeed (or they are very cruel to Souls) to tell them, they have no Natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Repent and Believe, to free them from this ſuppoſed errour, that they might be free from fault, and know they are not bound to comply with the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But is it no aggravation of the very not doing any thing, when a man thinks he can do it, and cannot?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer. Not in the leaſt: For Natural Impotency cometh not in the leaſt within Morality. You may as well ſay, it would leſſen a mans fault before God, that thinketh he hath no greater an eſtate then will meerly ſerve his Family-neceſſities, and ſpends it on a great Feaſt, to have a ſuperfluous Eſtate before that's faln to him that he knew not of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Others make this Exception to the general rule, <hi>That mans Natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105933:15"/>to obey, doth excuſe from obedience, except the reaſon why men obey not, be, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot, though they cannot, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not;</hi> and this, ſay they, is the common cauſe of mens not Believing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting; they cannot with this proper <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> diſtinct from will-not; and yet that is not the reaſon why they do not Repent and Believe, but becauſe they will not, now though ſuch deſign the ſame (I believe) that I do in this diſcourſe, yet to bring theſe dark words into the light, is enough to ſhame them. Either they that make uſe of this evaſion mean by <hi>cannot,</hi> the Natural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of doing the very ſame thing that he cannot do; or elſe only deny the power of doing the thing he hath an Impotency to; but grant a power, notwithſtanding of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another thing required of him different from that he wants the Natural power of doing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If they mean it in the firſt ſenſe, <hi>ad idem,</hi> that a man cannot do the ſame thing required, but the reaſon why he doth it not, is not becauſe he cannot.</p>
            <p>Firſt: It is a Contradiction, as you may ſee in any inſtance keeping to the ſame, If a man have not the Natural power of Willing, this cannot but be a cauſe, yea a ſufficient cauſe, yea the only cauſe of his not Willing. It would be a ſtrange idle kind of hindrance that hinders not; a ſtrange kind of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to doing, that hinders not that doing,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105933:16"/>that is no reaſon of the not doing. This is to ſay, A mans blindneſs is no reaſon or cauſe of his not ſeeing, or, not the only cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly: It is contrary to expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſay, their <hi>cannot</hi> is no reaſon of their not Believing. We muſt ſay, that a mans Impotency of Believing, in what ſenſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we take his Impotency, is the cauſe and reaſon of his not Believing: For that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency that Chriſt ſpeaks of, is given as the reaſon why men Believe not on him, <hi>John</hi> 6.64, 65. There are ſome of you that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not: For Jeſus knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who they were that Believed not, and he ſaid, <hi>Therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given him of my Father.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 843. <hi>Why do you not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my ſpeech? Even becauſe you cannot hear my Word; you are of your Father the Devil;</hi> that is, You are ſo wicked, you are of ſuch Deviliſh qualities.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If they mean by theſe words, that the fault is, notwithſtanding their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, that they do not ſome other thing than that they have the Impotency to; and ſo the meaning is, He hath an Impotency to ſomthing; but his fault is, that he doth not that which he hath a power to do, and hath no Impotency at all to. Firſt: This rather confirms what I am ſaying, yea overgoe's me quite, as you will after ſee. Secondly: This is no more to the purpoſe, than to ſay,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105933:16"/>A blind man is too blame for not hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Impotency to ſeeing, doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hearing; yet this is apparently the chief Part of the meaning of this ſaying, as it is applyed by thoſe that uſe it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: This Saying leaneth upon an aiery, nice, falſe implyed difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; or it would have no colour of reaſon, which is this, between Willing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, endeavouring to Repent and Believe, and Actual Believing and Repenting. But any that looks upon theſe actions as elicit acts of the Will (with the heart man Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and Repenteth) may know, this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Imperate acts require another power diſtinct from the Will to execute them, and ſo may be hindered by the want of that other Power, as want of Eſtate to give; but it is otherwiſe where they are not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, but only Elicited. What ſhould hinder, if a man Willed it to the prevailing degree? nay it is the thing it ſelf, and if one could ſuppoſe ſuch a thing poſſible, God would accept it without the diſtinct thing from it you ſuppoſe, called Repenting and Believing, while he would do it, and it is no fault of his, no want of Will, they do not follow; and to think otherwiſe, would be to have hard thoughts of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: This leaneth upon another falſe foundation, that men have no Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency at all to Willing, deſiring, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring that which is good; which to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105933:17"/>affirm, as I ſaid before, is Pelagianiſm. Yet, you muſt not charge men with that doctrine that follows from their unwary obſcure ſpeeches by remote conſequence, when it may be ſaid of them, That if they ſaw it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, they would not uſe thoſe ſpeeches, and do diſown the conſequence as not ſeeing it follow.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, <hi>I</hi> think, ſatisfactorily made out, that Natural Impotency doth excuſe from fault. This is the firſt property of Natural Impotency, wherein it differs from Moral; I have been large in this, but will recompence it with brevity in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Secondly: A ſecond property of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Impotency is this, Natural Impotency (<hi>viz.</hi> when a man hath not the faculty of willing, or cannot do the thing if he would) would make all conditional promiſes made upon condition of doing that that men have this Impotency to do, nullities. Suppoſe the promiſe made to faln man that hath no wings, If you fly you ſhall be ſaved, would not this have been ſo far from gracious, as to be a Nullity? Yea though <hi>Adam</hi> had had wings, and loſt them by his ſin, from himſelf and us; as indeed I grant the caſe to be much ſo, in reſpect of original ſin between <hi>Adam</hi> and us: Could any man ſetiouſly give thanks for ſuch a promiſe, or ſay, It was a kind and gracious promiſe?</p>
            <p>The ſticking to this opinion of mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105933:17"/>Impotency to perform the Goſpel-condition, hath driven ſome, otherwiſe learned and worthy men, to deny, Such are promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> If men Believe and Repent, they ſhall be ſaved; and to uſe this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their opinion, that if they be, they are no more gracious than the Law. <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay, their argument is unanſwerable, if a man now have no more power to fulfil the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-condition, than to make all his ſins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Nay, there are no degrees in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities or total Cannots. It is no more of grace to ſay to a man, If thou wilt run a mile <hi>I</hi> will give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he cannot, than if thou wilt run a thouſand. To ſay, men have not the Natural power to perform the Goſpel-condition, is to ſet forth God as one that mocketh; and to ſay, He will encreaſt their miſery if they do not, is to ſet him forth as doing <hi>(horreſco refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns)</hi> worſe than mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What fearful things are extreams?</p>
            <p>Thirdly: While there is this Natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of obedience to a command, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of a promiſe, men that obey not, or fall ſhort of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, will never repent of, or befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it; for that which they could not help if they would never ſo much. <hi>I</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear aggravating this opinion, as having load enough on its back already to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate man ſtand off leſt it fall on him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I</hi> come to ſpeak of the Moral or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thical Impotency. It is a thing as quite
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105933:18"/>different from Natural Impotency as can be almoſt ſuppoſed, as I ſhall ſhew you. They agree in nothing, but only in the thing that is the reaſon of the Metaphor borrowed from Natural Impotency, to expreſs this by which is this, That as a lame man cannot walk, a blind man ſee, or dead ariſe without a Miracle; ſo neither can theſe ever Repent and believe without ſome wonderful help from Heaven, though upon another account it cannot be done, and not becauſe they want the Natural power of doing it.</p>
            <p>Moral Impotency is when a man hath the Natural power, can do the thing in reſpect of his Natural powers, but will not; and not only ſo, but cannot obtain of himſelf to will it, though yet he hath the Natural power of obtaining this of himſelf, elſe it would be a Natural Impotency; as, a Fool hath not the Natural power to obtain of himſelf to will a thing, hath not the right Natural uſe of his faculties; So (as all agree) a man hath not the Natural power of willing his own miſery, as his miſery; or of nilling his own happineſs: his ſoul is not framed capable of theſe things; and therefore theſe things come not within Morality; neither are, nor poſſibly can be matter of a ſerious command or ſerious prohibition.</p>
            <p>Theſe expreſſions, <hi>à ſe impetrare non poteſt ut velit;</hi> he cannot find in his heart to chuſe it, cannot obtain of himſelf to will it, ſeem he fitteſt to repreſent it to you by.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105933:18"/>
            <p>And it is not from any Natural defect that he cannot find in his heart, cannot obtain of himſelf to will it, but from his Wickedneſs, his pride, Covetouſneſs, Malice, Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſuch things as prevail with his will in a Moral way, to keep it faſt to them, <hi>John</hi> 5 44 <hi>How can you Believe, that ſeek honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only: That is</hi> (<hi>as you may ſee, comparing cap</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 43) <hi>This hinders you from giving your ſelves up to me and my obedience, your Pride, your affectation of applauſe, your care to keep up your Repute amongſt your Friends and Acquaintants.</hi> This Impotency is the ſame with that which a man means when he ſaith, <hi>I cannot break my own Legs;</hi> not but that he can do it if he would, but he is ſo reſolved to the contrary upon ſome arguments that prevail with him, that all that you can ſay, cannot Perſwade him to do it.</p>
            <p>This Impotency is a rational thing, ſo far as that may be called rational which is done upon reaſons, but inconſiderable and ſlight reaſons, and upon fallacious arguments and grounds, and ſuch as he doth, or might know to be fallacious, did he make due uſe of his reaſon: Elſe it would be a Natural Impotency, and a man could be no more blamed for it, than you can blame a man for his antipathy to Cheeſe, that is not choſen upon any arguments. Now in this ſenſe a <hi>Cannot</hi> and <hi>Will not</hi> are all one; they do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105933:19"/>not differ <hi>ſpecie,</hi> in kind; only, in degree: It is a higher degree of volition or chuſing; you may call it Wilfulneſs, ſtubbornneſs, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, Moral Impotency, all theſe ſignifie the ſame. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18. <hi>If a man have a ſtubborn Son that will not obey the voyce of his Father,</hi> Stubborneſs is only a Will not obey, not a Cannot in the propereſt ſenſe as oppoſed to Will not; only a higher degree of will not, but of the ſame ſpecies. In this ſenſe are apparently theſe and ſuch Scriptures to be underſtood; Can the blackmore change his skin? ſo, He that is accuſtomed to evil cannot do well. The firſt Cannot here is Natural, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault; he cannot change his skin if he would never ſo fain, and therefore a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to change it would not oblige: But the ſecond is the Moral Cannot, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.4. Joſephs <hi>Brethren hated him, and could not ſpeak peaceably to him;</hi> that is, through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, not but that they could if they would. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.7. <hi>Trouble me not, my door is ſhut, and my children in bed, I cannot riſe to give thee.</hi> This cannot is a will-not upon ſuch reaſons, and is ſo explained in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; Though he will not riſe; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Importunity he will riſe and give him whatſoever he needeth. In this ſenſe the Carnal mind is Enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God; neither in deed can be, in this Moral ſenſe, And God giveth us power in this ſenſe (obſerve, I do not ſay only in this ſenſe, but moſtly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105933:19"/>as the chief meaning, for ſomthing <hi>I</hi> could ſay, but <hi>I</hi> muſt not intermix things aliene) not by giving new faculties; but by cauſing us to will, and do of his own good pleaſure. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. And in this ſenſe we pray, <hi>Create in us a clean heart, and renew a right Spirit within us. No man can come to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw him,</hi> meaneth no more than that, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</hi> only it may denote a more ſtrong overflowing ſtream of the will, and a reſolved refuſal of him: or, to ſpeak more exactly, it denotes the Will-not with a <hi>modus;</hi> and modes do not differ really from the things modified; It denotes the Will not with this wicked modification, that this will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not will always continue, unleſs God do by ſome ſuper-effluence of his grace make them willing of unwilling; not but that they had the Natural power or faculty of willing it, or could if they would without that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious drawing; but they were ſo reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſubmitting to him, that they could not obtain to will the contrary; yea this <hi>Cannot</hi> was through their own choice upon ſome reaſons like that, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.20. <hi>He had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Wife and could not come:</hi> The deſign of the parable is to ſhew what hinders men from coming to Chriſt, and how inexcuable they are in refuſing ſuch offers; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is not, that his new Wife did cling about him, or tye his legs that he could not, (for this would have excuſed;) but that he choſe to ſtay and entertain himſelf with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105933:20"/>his new Married Wife, as more deſirable to him than the Feaſt. And ſo, one muſt go ſee his Oxen, and another his Farme. The meaning is, it is ſo far from being an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing to me, whether I leave my Wife to go or not, that I ſo quite praeponderate the other way, that I cannot ſo much as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of my ſelf to parley about it, to debate upon it; my reaſon is ſo great, that you may well excuſe me; have me excuſed. Dut this will admit of no excuſe, there is no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given for forſaking the Fountain of Living Waters, to go to broken Ciſterns; and this they did, or might have known.</p>
            <p>I could here, if there was need, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate further to you, that it is impoſſible there ſhould be any thing but Will in this Impotency; for if there was, it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe ſo far. But this will appear more fully in going on, and I ſuppoſe I may ſpare my ſelf that labour: For to make this fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to you, is I think enough to prove it. And therefore I will repreſent it further to you. The Angels in Heaven have an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of Sinning (if I may call the Moral perfection an Impotency, which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be called the Moral power, being a holy rectitude of Will, and the power oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Moral Impotency, <hi>in eodem genere morale;</hi> and ſo is of the ſame general nature, and fit to explain this by; for it is a <hi>Moral Cannot</hi> ſin, not a <hi>Natural,</hi> for they have the Natural power of ſinning, can ſin if they would; elſe it would
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105933:20"/>not be laudable Morally; no more than it is, that a Beaſt cannot ſin) they have ſuch a Moral rectitude and goodneſs, they cannot obtain of themſelves to Will it; but you may as well go and perſwade a man in his right mind to put his hand into the fire: they neither will nor (in the ſenſe explained) can Will it, nor dare, (the Angel durſt not bring a railing accuſation) and that for ſubſtantial and weighty reaſons. This calls to mind thoſe expreſſions, <hi>How can I do this evil.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Thou can'ſt not bear thoſe that are evil.</hi> And 1. <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>He cannot ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God;</hi> and, Gods people <hi>are dead and Crucified unto the World and to ſin.</hi> Which laſt words ſhew, that if you will have <hi>dead</hi> in Scripture alwayes to ſignifie a want of Natural power, you muſt ſay that Gods people have not a Natural power to ſin, cannot ſin if they would.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay farther, you have ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, as of Angels, and of good men (I mean Analogically) though you ſhould in anger ſay, you have not; Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I am ſure, you ought to have ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; for otherwiſe you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and ſinful apprehenſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, which ſpeaketh in ſuch a way as God muſt ſpeak, or elſe could not be underſtood by us, in ſpeaking of Himſelf. I ſay, you have ſuch apprehenſions of God, as you borrow from theſe things amongſt men, when you thank God for keeping Covenant and Promiſe; you apprehend, He hath the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105933:21"/>Natural power of deſtroying you when he will, notwithſtanding-his promiſe; elſe you cannot poſſibly thank him for keeping Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. You might indeed admire him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a contrary Conception; but not thank him; for Thanks, in the very formal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, is for doing ſome thing that one had a Natural power to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould conceive that his Promiſe, like ſome kind of Charm, did take away his Natural power of being provoked to will or do otherwiſe; it would be a very finful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; for, during ſuch a Conception, a man could not give thanks for his keeping promiſe, unleſs in jeſt. You have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his keeping promiſe, as not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from not having Natural power to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; but you conceive of him as being hindered from deſtroying his people, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great provocations, and from dealing falſly in his Covenant, upon the account of ſomthing in him, that you conceive of Analogically to Moral Virtue and goodneſs, even Juſtice, and Faithfulneſs and Truth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.16. <hi>I will look upon the Bow in the Cloud, that I may remember my Covenant;</hi> Implying, he hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Earth again with a Flood, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now I will, according as I promiſed, ſhew you the different properties of this <hi>Moral Impotency</hi> from Natural; and it is contrary in every thing to Natural, which ſhews they are contrary indeed.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:105933:21"/>
            <p>Firſt: this Moral Impotency doth not excuſe from fault, or make threatnings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Nay it is alſo in this contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural (which <hi>I</hi> would have you obſerve and conſider well, to convince you of their great difference); That the Natural Impotency, the greater it is, by ſo much the more it doth leſſen the fault in not obeying the command; and the leſs it is, by ſo much the more it doth greaten the fault: But the greater it is the greater is the fault, and more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and further from excuſe; and the leſs it is, the leſs faulty. For any to ſay, <hi>I</hi> cannot-but hate the Miniſter that reproves me; and any that live holy lives, <hi>I</hi> cannot but wiſh ſome great fall or miſchief to them; for they call my ſins to my remembrance, and admoniſh me to leave my wicked ways; and <hi>I</hi> am reſolved not to leave them; <hi>I</hi> have ſo firmly choſen this way, that <hi>I</hi> am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to change: This is the meaning of [<hi>I</hi> cannot obtain of my ſelf to leave this way] will any ſay, this is not a greater fault? If a Thief ſhould ſay, Once <hi>I</hi> was almoſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have left my courſe of life; but now <hi>I</hi> am reſolved to ſtick to it, notwithſtanding all Laws and dangers; and he ſay true, Is he not now more too blame than formerly, and leſs excuſeable? Would not all humane Judicatures look upon that man as mad, that ſhould ſay, This doth excuſe, or not aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his fault?</p>
            <p>Secondly: This Moral Impotency doth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105933:22"/>not hinder promiſes from being of Grace. This is not to mock men, to promiſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if they will do that which they have this Moral Impotency to do. Nay ſuch a promiſe is not a jot leſs gracious, than if there was all readineſs and willingneſs of mind in us to embrace it, by performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when only, choſen, wicked willfulneſs hinders. He is bound nevertheleſs to thank him; and, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Mans unbelief cannot make the Faith (meaning the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs) of God of none effect; ſo our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and unthankfulneſs doth not make the Grace of God ceaſe to be Grace, and his kindneſs ceaſe to be kindneſs.</p>
            <p>If an Act of Oblivion be made by the Prince (when the Rebels are in his power, and Juſtice ſaying, Shall I ſmite them, ſhall I ſmite them?) provided they will acknowledg their offence in ſome humble manner and ſubmit; if ſome, yea if all ſhould ſay, and that truly, We ſo hate him, notwithſtanding this kindneſs; and we ſhall be ſo ſcoffed at by thoſe we have made great boaſts of our reſolvedneſs unto, and they will ſay, <hi>Where is that mouth wherewith thou ſaid'ſt, Who is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Judg 9.38.</note> 
               <hi>Abimeleck?</hi> that we cannot through theſe reaſons obtain of our own wilful and proud hearts to ſubmit; yet it was a great favour and kindneſs, as long as the condition was ſo eaſie to them, that they had the Natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſo eaſily to do it. Yea, and though they had no benefit by it, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105933:22"/>was increaſed. So though it may truly be ſaid of ſome, <hi>It was good for them if they had never been born,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt never been born, or dyed,</hi> and <hi>no Law of Grace ever made;</hi> yet all this hinders it not from being of Grace, while this falling-ſhort, was through their own wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: They that through this Moral Impotency, this inſuperable obſtinacy, refuſe to yield, will befool themſelves, Was I mad! I was told and knew: What hindred me, but my own wickedneſs?</p>
            <p>I will now ſet before you one Inſtance to make all plain, and to call the ſumme of what hath been ſaid to your mind. Suppoſe a Father hath a Son, both Vicious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't, and alſo Lame; which Lameneſs (becauſe I will foreſtall all poſſibility of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) proceeded from ſome former wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, as, in endeavouring to kill his Father: Suppoſe his Father ſhould ſay, Thou haſt long deſerved to be diſ-inherited, and I am now about to diſ-inherit thee irrecoverably in ſelling my Land; But now Run, and I will receive the into favour. He may reply, <hi>Father, I thank you for nothing, this is to mock, I cannot.</hi> And again, here is no fault in not-running, and he will never afterwards befool himſelf for, and repent of not-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though diſ-inherited upon it: This is Natural Impotency. But now, ſuppoſe the Father ſay, <hi>Son, thou art Vicicus and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't, living looſely abroad; but now live at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105933:23"/>home with me, and leave theſe Vicious courſes, and I will receive thee;</hi> He hath the Moral Impotency to this, <hi>Can the Blackmore change his skin? ſo he accuſtomed to evil, cannot do well;</hi> and ſo the Son goes on in his old courſe, and cannot obtain of himſelf to do otherwiſe. Here notwithſtanding, he ought to ſay, Father, I thank you, this is a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to condeſcend to ſuch eaſie terms, after ſuch great provocations; and this will not excuſe him; and he will be-fool himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſay, <hi>Oh that I had hearkened!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But, Is not the whole of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe notoriouſly againſt the knowledg and experience of men? Cannot we ſay of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, They would forſake their ſins but cannot? and do not the beſt complain with <hi>Paul, when they would do good, evil is preſent,</hi> and they have a will, when yet to do good they find not? they are ſure they would do more good than they do. And do you ſay, They do not ſin in not doing thoſe things they would, but cannot?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt: There is a willingneſs in wicked men to eſcape Condemnation, and attain Salvation: this is ſuppoſed, elſe God would never promiſe theſe upon a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though yet they may be ſaid indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and interpretatively, to will and chuſe death, in chuſing thoſe courſes that lead to it, and ſo have their choice, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in periſhing: for they chuſe rather to undergo his wrath, than to accept him on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105933:23"/>the tearms and conditions of his love and favour.</p>
            <p>Secondly: They would, if it could be (and wiſh it might be ſo) have Chriſt, and Heaven, and their Luſts too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: They, or many of them, are willing to do many things for Salvation, would part with ſome ſins they can beſt ſpare, and do ſome duties they have no great averſneſs to, and ſo either do leave ſuch ſins, or would actually if they really thought, Going ſo far would ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: They, or ſome of them, have a remiſs Will to perform the whole Goſpel-condition, to give up themſelves to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith; but the actual choice, the prevailing part of their will, is againſt it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Inſtance is pertinent to explain this by, <hi>ad Nicom. lib.</hi> 3. A Mariner caſts his goods over-board in a Storm, to ſave his Life and Ship. He puts the queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch actions ſhould be called voluntary or involuntary; he calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>mixt actions,</hi> for (ſaith he) No man would caſt away his goods, altogether willingly; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but they are (ſaith he) rather voluntary actions; for they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and preferred by them as the wiſeſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſuch Circumſtances. Such a man would fain have his riches preſerved, and yet rather than loſe his life, chuſes not to keep them; reſolved, though repining, to caſt them away, with the prevailing choice.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105933:24"/>And though the other weaker inclination be a will, a remiſs will, or volition naturally ſo called, and really, being a deſire upon ſome reaſons, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rightly, yet Morally it may be ſaid to be no-Will: For it is not to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, not being the prevailing choice, <hi>Qui mavult, vult,</hi> only in this ſenſe: ſo that you may ſay They will not, in ordinary cuſtom of ſpeaking: For where this chuſing-Will is, the imperate acts eſſentially follow, and are performed in ſome meaſure; or, where they do not follow, it is as much accepted by God as if they did, <hi>e. g.</hi> If a mans prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choyce be to go to the Church, he goes; If to ſtay at home, he ſtays; if to pray, he prays; to give, he gives: except there be ſuch a hindrance as will ſo far excuſe, as if he had done it; as, ſuppoſe the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhould be ſtiff or ſtubborn, when the Will is not.</p>
            <p>You ſee wicked men would have Chriſt and Heaven, and would therefore remiſly (what they are convinced is the only means) Holineſs of heart and life; yet the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will is rather to loſe happineſs, than to forgoe all their luſts; to let go the offered happineſs, rather than live a Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life; ſomthing unwilling, thus to loſe all; yet, with the prevailing bent of their will, prefer this ſinful courſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly: In the regenerate, the prevailing choice of their will, is for the beſt Intereſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105933:24"/>and this will Denominate, they are willing in the propereſt ſenſe: there is no ſin but they habitually would have ſtrength againſt it, and no duty, but they would have ſtrength to perform it; And this will be accepted of God unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>But yet their Will is renewed but in part, and they have much unwillingneſs to it, and will to the contrary; they do not will in ſuch a degree as they ought; and this is their ſin. They would do ſuch and ſuch difficult duties, and yet they would not; and this is a Lamentation, and ſhould be for a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When I ſay, they <hi>Would</hi> in a prevailing degree, I know this cannot always be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly <hi>pro Hic &amp; Nunc,</hi> elſe they would never omit any known duty, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any known ſin; for, the Imperate acts would follow the Elicit.</p>
            <p>I am ſomthing at a loſs here, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Conceptions, which are not very clear. But you may conceive, a Child may ſome-time diſobey, provoke his Parents, though his general and habitual bent of heart and will be, to pleaſe him. And ſo, Gods people's willingneſs to the whole, and in general, is greater than their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though not in the particular Act of known ſin; elſe I could not tell how to maintain, that a Regenerate man hath the Goſpel-condition in the main, during a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin, and ſo is not unjuſtified; whereas I cannot think, ſuch a one hath quite changed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105933:25"/>his ultimate end, and is become unſanctified, like another man for a time. Me-thinks thoſe words of the Apoſtle ſerve beſt of any I can think of, to expreſs my meaning by, which if it be not the meaning of the words, I only allude to them, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>So then, with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh the Law of Sin.</q> I my ſelf, which part do I my ſelf wiſh moſt may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail? which ſide do I take? which intereſt do I frown at and wiſh might go down? That is <hi>I my ſelf,</hi> my will in the propereſt ſenſe, which I prevailingly, habitually chooſe, ſo as to be moſt diſpleaſed with my unwillingneſſe; and I find, I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, or not much, at my unwillingneſs to ſin.</p>
            <p>I know it is difficult, when a mans choice but-juſt turns the ſcale, and is not vehement to diſcern which part he prevailingly takes; And people though of great and ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to things above, and in whom things below have very little Intereſt; yet if their Reaſon be clouded with Melancholy or otherwiſe, it is hard for them to know which is I, <hi>I my ſelf,</hi> and which ſide they mainly take; yet this is the way to enquire: For come to a wicked man, and he may ſay, I my ſelf ſerve the fleſh and world, and that intereſt I am moſt careful to ſecure and maintain, whatever become of the Spirit's Intereſt; though my mind and Conſcience is for the Law of God, and ſerving of that;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105933:25"/>and ſo I have a will to do ſomthing; but the ſide I my ſelf take, and am moſt careful it go not down, is the Fleſh-intereſt. And to anſwer to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. I grant that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the perſon of a Regenerate man, though ſome worthy men oppoſe it, and as for what they object, that he ſpeaks of it as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> repreſents his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> man who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>below a Moral man;</hi> it is eaſily made apparently unlike, if one by ſin mean not groſs ſins, but thoſe of daily infirmity which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> accounted no ſins; and by Fleſh, mean the moſt ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, hated part of his will and affections; and by his Mind, the prevailing intereſt which he ſided with. However there is as much ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5 17. <hi>For the Fleſh Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, ſo that you cannot do the things which you would;</hi> which words are confeſſed to ſpeak of the Regenerate. But to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Firſt, I doubt not but the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be freed from many Natural Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that were his ſorrows and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſin, and not his ſins. Secondly, We muſt ſay, the reaſon why the Apoſtle or any other do not do any duty they would, is, becauſe they do not will it enough; and what he did will in the prevailing degree he did it in ſome imperfect meaſure. But he would fain have been freed from all unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and have gotten on his Will further, but could not obtain it. And whereas, he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105933:26"/>ſaith, <hi>It is no more I;</hi> that is in the vulgar ſenſe, as to denominate, not proceeding to the choice; for his countenanced, loved, prevailing choice was the contrary. It was againſt his will, which was moſt ſtrictly his will; (though too much his will); and ſo God would accept it to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: I add this as an overplus: Was there as full a willingneſs, as our frail and naturally defective humane Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, there could be no actual ſin; I mean ſo full a willingneſs only, as to exclude every degree of unwillingneſs. For, where the reaſon why men do not, is not at all, Becauſe in part they will not; there it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be only, Becauſe they cannot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no fault.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of what is here ſaid: If there be a willing mind as to the prevailing degree, to obey every command, God will in mercy accept it to Salvation. But, was there a willing mind to any thing, ſo willing as to have nothing of unwillingneſs; God would not in this caſe account ſin at all, nay though it was not done through ſome other hindrance. Thoſe that would freely give if they had it without any unwillingneſs, it will not be ſin they did not give.</p>
            <p>You may ſee alſo by this (farther than I thought to have ſpoken) that we have the Natural power, though not of undoing the ſins we have done: yet of unſinning actual obedience for the future; elſe we ſhould
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105933:26"/>not ſin in not performing perfect actual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; we onely want will: Which may much humble us, would we well conſider it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Tranſcribe to you a paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi>'s Willfull Impenitency, which ſpeaks as high as the moſt ingrateful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion I have uſed, <hi>page</hi> 25. <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</bibl> I quote this place the rather (ſaith he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many wreſt it to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. O, ſayes a wicked man, I have a good will, I would, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, but I cannot perform; Thus men miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this place, for look how far <hi>Paul</hi> would, he could perform: for the will hath <hi>potentiam executricem,</hi> and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative force over the man; what he did will, he did perform; he performed it in his heart, and tongue, and hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he would draw his will forwarder than it was, but could not; his very will was partly unwilling: he could not indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſo much as he would; that is, he could not draw on his will ſo ſtrongly as he would. His will was not perfectly ſanctified; no Saint in this world hath any compleatneſs of will; and therefore his performance is not perfect, becauſe his will is not perfect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I ſay, If thy will be converted to God, thou art Converted, obedience ever goes as far as the will: And therefore if thou art willing, it is certain thou art obedient,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105933:27"/>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. whoſoever is willing to obey, that man does obey in ſome meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Will hath power of Execution, and the whole man at command. This is the reaſon why Divines ſay that, The ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the will is the condition of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Thus he, <hi>verbatim;</hi> and <hi>page</hi> 86. We never ſin againſt the Goſpel, but only upon <hi>Will-nots;</hi> indeed we ſin againſt the Law in every of our Cannots.</q> This laſt paſſage I confeſs I do contradict, and ſo I think he doth himſelf in the paſſage before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and alſo in the following <hi>page</hi> 87. <hi>Conſcience can never condemn us, but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Will-nots.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould yet be dubious and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or contentious and quarrelſome, as indeed one may eaſily take occaſions, the ſaculties of the Soul being ſuch abſtruſe things;</p>
            <p>I ſhall appeal to them though they object either on one hand, or on the other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To thoſe that ſhould affirm a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impotency. Firſt; Dare you think that God hath promiſed to men Salvation if they do, and will puniſh them if they do not, things they cannot do, if they would never ſo fain? <hi>(etiamſi maxime velint.)</hi> If ſo, Can you think that an Act of Mercy, and this of Juſtice? would not this be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for no fault? Do you not ſay that the reaſon why a Deaf man is not bound by the command of hearing, or a Poor man of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105933:27"/>or the Fool by the command of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Goſpel, is, becauſe they cannot do it, or elſe they would be bound by theſe general commands as others? Is not this to grant that Gods Laws oblige to obedience, only <hi>quoad poſſe &amp; noſſe,</hi> as Lawyers ſpeak?<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> None can poſſibly evade here but by ſaying, as ſome do, It is true, ſuch Impotent people are not obliged, and the conſequence (that all are by the ſame reaſon exempted from doing what they cannot do) would be good, if this was the cauſe or reaſon why men are not obliged by ſuch general Laws; but this is not the reaſon, but the reaſon is, Becauſe God doth not require it of them, elſe the blind would be as much obliged to read, and the deaf to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I would ask one thus replying, ſuch queſtions, How doth he know ſince the Law is general, that God doth not require the deaf to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by knowing this, that God doth not require men to do what they cannot do? Again, Do you think that if God or man ſhould require things which we cannot do, that the Law would be as equal, as a Law requiring what man can do? and would the man be as much to blame in not doing, as if he could? And why doth not God require the deaf man to hear the Miniſter? is there no reaſon of it in the Nature of things? Suppoſe you ſhould have read a Command in Scripture, requiring you to forget all injuries, Would not Natural reaſon, and the notion you have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105933:28"/>of the injuſtice of requiring things impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, dictate to you to interpret ſuch a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Metaphorically, To forgive all injuries? And would you not have given this as your reaſon of ſo interpreting the words, Becauſe a man cannot forget a great injury if he would, hath not the Natural power of ſo doing, the Memory not being totally ſubject to the Will? A man may forgive, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget, who it was that injuriouſly lam'd him, or put out his eye. So alſo if a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had been of a great reward, If we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all injuries, would you not give this as your reaſon why you cannot interpret the words according to the firſt and propereſt ſenſe of the word [Forget], becauſe if you do, no thanks could be due for ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it would not be gracious but luſorious.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Did your hearts ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproach you, as ſinning in not doing that which you could not do, or omitting that you could not but omit? Tell me, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſelves, When and where, and for what, (I except Melancholy people out of this Appeal, for ſome of thoſe I have known to have had great trouble of mind for things they could not help) yea though your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Impotency came from ſin, as I think all Natural dulneſs of underſtanding, and blindneſs, and lameneſs of Body, do. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you had lived in a place where you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of Chriſt and the Goſpel, till you came to great years; And if as ſoon as you did
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105933:28"/>you had yielded to the Goſpel, Do you think your hearts would have reproached you that you received Chriſt no ſooner? I know you will anſwer, No. If I ask you why, I know you can give no anſwer but this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you could not; you wanted ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was Naturally neceſſary to enable you to that act, <hi>viz.</hi> an objective evidence. But do not your hearts reproach you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing him ſo long? you will ſay, Yea. Now you are very ignorant of right reaſoning, if you cannot draw the concluſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I appeal to thoſe on the other Extream that ſhould object againſt this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impotency, as either that there is no ſuch thing, or if there be that it would excuſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt: Art thou as inclinable to good as evil, to pleaſe God as to pleaſe thy Fleſh and Senſes? Canſt thou in this Moral ſenſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of thy ſelf to chuſe good and refuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? why then doſt thou not? Why doſt thou pray<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin <hi>well urging this,</hi> Ep. <hi>107.</hi> ad Vitalem.</note> him, to incline thy heart to his Teſtimonies? what need haſt thou or any elſe of the Spirit's help? doſt thou not ſee multitudes going on reſolvedly in wicked ways, notwithſtanding all rebukes, engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves more deeply againſt God and holineſs, that thou thinkeſt, unleſs God work ſome wonderful way by his Spirit, they can never obtain of themſelves to leave thoſe ways they are wedded to, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders but their own choyce? Again, Will you not grant that it may in ſome true
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105933:29"/>ſenſe be ſaid, That no man can live ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently as not to need Chriſt's death for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Omiſſions and Commiſſions? Now conſider, and you will find, that, while you allow, that no man ſinneth in not doing the things he hath a Natural Impotency to, you can in no ſenſe grant it true, while you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Moral Impotency, or deny it to be one kind or ſort of Impotency.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Thou goeſt on, or haſt gone on, in ſuch ſins, as thy heart is privy unto, and couldſt not of a long time obtain of thy ſelf to leave ſuch courſes; Doth not thy Conſcience tell thee, it would be juſt with God to Condemn thee; and with men (if great crimes) to puniſh thee for them? If a Thief, Robber, or Murtherer ſhould ſay (and ſay true) I was ſo reſolved, I could not obtain of my ſelf for all the Laws of God and man to leave my wicked wayes, is this an excuſe? Is he not juſtly yet puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? would'ſt not thou puniſh him if Judg? would'ſt thou not do unworthily to let him eſcape upon this pretence, though true? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou mayſt ſay againſt this in words to confound; yet it appears plain, though againſt thy will; It is to diſpute againſt the Sun's light, when we know it is ſo, though we cannot tell how. One may as well diſpute againſt motion, as that Antient did, becauſe ſo difficult to tell what it is. If he ſhould puzle you in ſaying, It was from my Pride and Covetouſneſs, or Enmity and Hatred, that I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105933:29"/>could not obtain of my ſelf to leave thoſe courſes; how could I help it but obey my Luſts? you are yet ſure, this doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and ſo are all Lawyers, yea and all men in the world; but this Impotency is of a different ſort from that which doth excuſe. The Will's hinderance by wicked habits, and the habits themſelves, ſo far as ſinful, are voluntary things. Covetouſneſs cannot be an unwilling thing, or Pride, or Enmity; no man is an Enemy to another againſt his Will. Do not miſ-interpret theſe words, I mean his whole will; elſe I know he may be an Enemy to a man, and Covetuous againſt his will; when his will is divided, and partly for it, and partly againſt it upon contrary Reaſons, as it is often even ſenſible in the beſt, though their darling, countenanced will and choice, is againſt it.</p>
            <p>Let any man tell me (and I will imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſider it, yea, I deſire help here) what a Vertuous or Vitious habit is, as different or diſtinct from an inclination of the will, which is <hi>appetitus totius ſuppoſiti,</hi> the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of the man, as other meerly ſenſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are not, that do not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that are not choſen upon reaſons, as other appetitions or averſations are not.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhould have ſome ſenſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite altogether againſt his will, it would not be Covetouſneſs, or Pride, or Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and if it ſhould in ſome little degree draw his will to it, yet ſo far as it is againſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105933:30"/>his will, it is without blame; and only ſo much as it hath the conſent of the will, or the will doth not diſſent enough, he is culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo Enmity, if a man ſhould have any particular averſation to another man or woman (like that, <hi>Non amo te, Sabidi</hi>) that is not choſen upon any reaſon, and ſo is not voluntary at all, it would not be called En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity univocally and properly. Vertuous and Vitious habits, are I think (I would not be over-confident where, for any thing I know, I go alone) only a continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed inveterate inclination of the Will.</p>
            <p>A man that hath choſen Riches to purſue them by all means direct or indirect as his end, wherein he places his felicity, is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, and, continuing this choice, is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually Covetous. Did he now chuſe God for his ultimate end, and conſtantly and reſolvedly will holineſs and the pleaſing of <hi>God,</hi> he would be habitually holy. If any ſhould have a Conception of ſuch habits, as things that are not volitions, or, which is all one, inclination of the will, but diſtinct from them <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and things that men could not put off if they would, it would be an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conception; for they would not then be Vertuous or Vitious; and <hi>God</hi> would not require the putting them off, and it would not be the duty of ſuch men to will what is good, if they could not, had not the Natural power, to will good, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch habits. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105933:30"/>was a man <hi>acute</hi> to admiration in ſuch things, ſeems to ſleep, and forget what he had proved, That all Virtue and Vice is voluntary, <hi>Ad Nicom. Lib.</hi> 3. when he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, do well, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than according to theſe habits.</p>
            <p>I have told you the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>he accuſtomed to do evil, cannot do well:</hi> he can if he would; but he cannot Morally obtain of himſelf to Will it. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, he cannot if he would: but he ſaith, Such habits are yet to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or voluntary, becauſe thoſe Acts were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, whereby they brought them on themſelves; and he brings this Inſtance to ſhew in what ſenſe they are voluntary, When a man hath brought a Diſeaſe on himſelf by Intemperance, he may be ſaid to be ſick of a voluntary Diſeaſe, though he would fain be freed from it and cannot. Any one may ſee that, if the caſe was ſo, you could not call them vitious habits <hi>formaliter,</hi> and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>formaliter</hi> and properly: but only ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and voluntary figuratively, originally, <hi>effectivè,</hi> as every puniſhment of ſin is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe voluntary ſins were the cauſe of them. If a man ſhould ſay, I would not at all be Covetous, and chuſe the world for my chief good, but I do chuſe it; Would it not be a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105933:31"/>Contradiction? And if ſuch a thing was poſſible, would it not be far from being ſin and puniſhable? You may ſee by this, that ſuch habits are only this Moral Impotency, the wilfulneſs it ſelf under another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould yet be unſatisfied, and think Vitious habits are not Elicited, but Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; Let him reduce them to what notion he will, and it will come all to one for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for he muſt then ſay of them, as of all other Imperate things, that they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the will wholly, or ſo far as they are not, they are ſinleſs, and that God doth not require us to put them off.</p>
            <p>If you will have them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and meerly ſenſitive inclinations, then they are not Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous any more than they are conſented to, or not enough diſliked; As ſuppoſe you ſhould call a great Thirſt (brought upon a man by exceſſive drinking) Drunkenneſs. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, either they take away the Natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Willing (<hi>i.e.</hi> make him no Rational Creature) and then they would excuſe; or they cauſe that a man cannot Will good if he would (pardon this Contradiction, for I ſpeak it <hi>docendi cauſa</hi>) and this would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe indeed. A thing impoſſible cannot be a Moral fault. Or they only hinder the effects of the Will, the Imperate acts; and then they ſo excuſe, that God would accept his Will without thoſe Imperate acts. But theſe would be irrational notions of Moral
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105933:31"/>habits: for let any man conſider, and he may eaſily ſee (I think) that they are not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſpecie</hi> from volitions, that is, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Will, but comprehend in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome kind of radication and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of volition, that we cannot well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Doubtleſs they are not a kin to other habits, which only enable the ſubject facily and dextrouſly to do the act; for a good man could as facily and dextrouſly commit a ſin as another man, but will not.</p>
            <p>Now to let you ſee further a neceſſity of thus diſtinguiſhing, conſider how the Ancients were, for want of this diſtinguiſhing, puzled to anſwer the <hi>fallacious</hi> arguments for the <hi>Pelagian</hi>

His commands are poſſible (ſaith he going on) becauſe ſome men can keep one part and ſome another of the commands, but yet none can keep all; and adds, therefore it is not the duty of ſingle men to keep them all: and ſo God commands nothing but what we can do; But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is expreſs againſt this of <hi>Jerom, Serm.</hi> 191. <hi>de Tempore</hi>

            <p>Councils are called againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi>

And the <hi>Orange</hi> Council againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> determines, that all Baptized ones, Chriſt helping and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating<note n="*" place="margin">Depent &amp; poſſunt.</note> can, and ought to fulfil all things neceſſary to Salvation, if they would labour faithfully. But any one may ſee, though theſe Councils meant well and Orthodoxly, as will appear to any peruſing their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; yet the difficulty remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, and will do ſo for ever, without this Diſtinction. For they rightly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as all the Ancient Fathers before them, that no man ought to do more than he can do; And therefore, without diſtinguiſhing, it cometh to all one for the anſwering the difficulty, whether the Grace they ſpeak of be given, or not given. For ſuppoſe it be affirmed that this Grace is given to men, Then either they can obey perfectly, ſo as to need no pardon; and this they abhorred the affirming of: or if they cannot with this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105933:34"/>Grace given, obey perfectly, ſo as to have no need of pardon, or Chriſts ſatisfaction; then they are Innocent, and ſin not, in not living perfectly, and ſo need no pardon in not obeying perfectly, it being no fault not to obey perfectly, ſince they Cannot obey perfectly. Again, ſuppoſe it be affirmed, that this grace is not given to men to obey perfectly, but only their meaning was, That God could, if he had ſo pleaſed, have given men ſuch Grace as might inable them to live without ſin, but did not. Then they were not bound to live without ſin, and ſo were, or might be perfect ſtill; As a man that is tyed by Sickneſs to his Bed, can by the help and aſſiſtance of God, go to the Church, <hi>viz. When God ſhall ſo raiſe him up;</hi> yet till God do ſo firſt raiſe him up, he is not bound to go, needs no pardon for not going.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when all is ſaid, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of man's Power and Impotency, ſo as we may truly ſay, A man can in one ſenſe without Grace, obey perfectly, hath the Natural faculty and power to do it, or he could not be obliged to it by the Law; (the Law would be no law to him, no more than the general command of hearing the Word is a Law, or Obligatory to a man Deaf; and the effect of Grace, is not the giving this power, elſe we might ſay, A man could not ſin unleſs God gave him Grace:) And alſo, that we may ſay truly; A man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105933:34"/>cannot in another ſenſe obey perfectly, nor do any good thing without Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Morally; his Wickedneſs, his Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is Moral Impotency hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And every man underſtands this, though he know not how to expreſs it, as you will perceive by asking any man, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his Omiſſions or Commiſſions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not have avoided thoſe ſins, though God did not give him that Grace to avoid them eventually. When any man is lamenting his long refuſal of Chriſt, he knoweth in ſome ſenſe he could have done otherwiſe; God gave him help and power enough naturally-neceſſary (yea, few or rather none that enjoy the Goſpel, but they can ſay <hi>more than enough,</hi> elſe he could not befool himſelf for thus refuſing mercy; Though God did not give him Grace ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take away his reſiſtance, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and ſo to cauſe him actually and eventually to turn from ſin to God; and yet in ſome ſenſe he could not do otherwiſe; God not giving him Grace ſooner, that would eventually take away his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cauſe him actually to chuſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the terms of it.</p>
            <p>I may add here, How this diſtinction doth wonderfully ſerve to reconcile the Doctrine of the Ancients to themſelves,

Now I greatly diſlike this Notion, and this alſo muſt either fall, or the notion of Moral Impotency, and what hath been ſaid of it, falls; as not ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any ſtead, but excuſing as well as the Natural. I ſhall therefore ſearch more narrowly into it, and alſo into what can be ſaid any way, that I can think of, againſt what is here propounded.</p>
            <p>I wiſh any Oppoſer was now here (for I would impartially know the truth) that would ſoberly tell me what he would have God do to wicked men, to make them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, if he pretend that this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this end, that they have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties, and promiſes, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and providences afflicting or proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; that is an object intelligible, fitted and ſuited objectively to work this great change of heart and will:</p>
            <p>I am confident ſuch a one could only name theſe five things with any ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and he that can name a ſixth, <hi>erit mihi parvus Apollo,</hi> would do more than ever was done yet.</p>
            <p>Firſt; I would have God give a man more of the Natural power and faculty of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105933:37"/>chuſing good, and refuſing evil, that he may be inexcuſable. But this is irrational; He hath power of willing good, and if a third or fourth power, yea, if ten times as much power of willing good was given him, it would be all one; For this is no reaſon at all of his not willing good, becauſe he hath not the Natural power to will it, elſe it would excuſe; but he will not chuſe it: And they that do chuſe good, and refuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, have not more of this Natural faculty, are not more men, are not in this ſenſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Natural fools than other men.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Or I would have God give him more of the Goſpel, ſend more Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and awakening providences; yea, ſend ſome from the Dead. But this was well anſwered, They have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that was enough to make them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, and theſe under the Goſpel have more than ſo, more than the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; I would have God to make them actually willing, that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. But this is a contradiction, and it is to ſay, Wicked men and Devils do not ſin, except God actually make them not to ſin. And yet this is the meaning of ſuch paſſages, or they are not ſenſe; It doth not excuſe for God to give the faculties of willing (which is the power of chuſing it) except he give them alſo preventing Grace; that is, make them willing actually. Indeed when
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105933:37"/>all is ſaid, you muſt ſay, or ſay worſe, that, That Grace, concerning which the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is, lyeth, in making men actually wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as diſtinct from giving power of Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, call it ſecond or third power, or what you will, and the deſign of what I ſay here, is not to oppoſe this, but to prove it, as you will ſee in going on; but only I am ſhewing here that Gods denying of this, doth not excuſe men, ſo as it can be ſaid, they do not ſin in not obeying the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Or Fourthly: I would have him make them to be without Temptation to ſin, that they may be without excuſe: But will not your Servant be without excuſe in Robbing you, unleſs he had no temptation to it: This is an unreaſonable demand; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God promiſes a far greater good than that they deprive themſelves of by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and threatens a far greater evil to them ſinning, than that they incur by their obedience. Would you have no ſelf-denyal in the World? Many obey God, that have greater temptations to diſobedience in thoſe things wherein they obey, than thoſe have that diſobey him in ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; Or I would have God make them leſs actually unwilling to good, and take off from them much of this Moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, or choſen reſolvedneſs to go on in ſinfull wayes (which is in part to ſanctifie them, and to make them in part actually willing to deny themſelves, as any one may
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105933:38"/>eaſily underſtand) and then they will be too blame, and be guilty of ſin if they obey not.</p>
            <p>Firſt; Suppoſe God do not this (as we are certain he doth not to all) yet are not you and all men in the world ſure, This doth not excuſe? Elſe the moſt incorrigible and wilful offenders would be moſt ſinleſs and excuſable. Can any man in earneſt ſay that a man is not bound to leave his evil wayes, and that he doth not ſin in going on in them, while he is fully and peremptorily reſolved to go on in them? Yet this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth apparently to be the meaning of many learned men in pleading for an indifferancy of Will.</p>
            <p>Secondly; What way is there poſſible to cauſe a man to leave off this wilfulneſs, to put off this Vitious habit, which he hath the Natural power to put off if he would, that is threatned enough, and promiſed enough, but ſome way moving a volition, by ſome way cauſing him to deſire the good, and diſlike the evil?</p>
            <p>If you ſhall ſay, I would have him take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Vitious habits, you hide your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in obſcure words, or you mean, I would have him not only give him the power of willing the contrary, which he hath; but alſo ſome way make his Will encline to the other way, that he may be inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Do not you uſe to Object, that this would be to deſtroy the freedom of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105933:38"/>mans will, and ſo his humane Nature, to cauſe the volition any other way than by giving the power of Willing? For if God may, by his Spirit, in ſome way to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, diſtinct from meerly propounding the object (which he doth where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preached without difference) without deſtroying mans freedom, take away in part mans great Wilfulneſs or Unwillingneſs to good; why may he not quite and totally (or however to the prevailing degree) take away thus, by his Spirit, his Unwillingneſs to Good, and cauſe a man to Will or chuſe Good, without deſtroying his Freedom?</p>
            <p>Do not now put this all off with theſe common words unexplained (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction may have a good ſenſe, if rightly explained), <hi>viz:</hi> God giveth all men Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace, elſe they would be in no fault, and upon their right uſe of that, he giveth them Subſequent Grace. I will ſhew you that theſe words do but hide your meaning; and that by the ſubſequent, you mean no more than by your preventing Grace, and by preventing Grace, no more then the faculty or power of willing and obeying, if one would; you make the ſubſequent Grace to be given only <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> upon the ſuppoſition men uſe the preventing well. Conſider therefore a little, that you call preventing Grace, whether is this the ſame with ſome of thoſe things before-mentioned, or ſome thing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105933:39"/>diſtinct? Whether is this preventing Grace any more than Gods general, povidential Act of making men Naturally perfect, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men the power or faculty of chuſing Good and Evil, and ſo leaving them to their meer ſelf-determination? If not, it is no more than giving the faculties, which is rather to be called giving<note n="*" place="margin">Poſſe habere fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp; Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae eſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum: habere autem gratiae fidelium. <hi>Aug. de praed. Sanct. cap. 5.</hi>
               </note> Nature, than Grace. If you ſay (as ſome do, and then unſay it again) this preventing Grace doth more, for it doth excite and move.</p>
            <p>Let me ask, Doth it excite and move po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentially only, or actually and really? you will, it may be, ſay, Actually; for to ſay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly potentially is a contradiction, and is no more than it doth not, but it would move if it was not hindred (which I ſhall after take notice of) therefore you will ſay, It doth actually move and excite. Now what doth it move and excite but the Will? And what is that but to cauſe actual Willing? If it excite motion, there is no motion of the Will but willing and nilling, conſenting or diſſenting, liking of the thing it is moved to or diſliking; and it doth not move nilling diſſent or diſlike of the good; if it really move and excite, it doth not move nothing, this would be to cauſe a ſtanding motion So that this, if granted, is to grant that God doth not meerly give power by it to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105933:39"/>will to move it ſelf, but doth, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this, move the Will, which you ſo much dread. If you ſhall ſay (as <hi>I</hi> know you will at laſt) <hi>movet, ſed nihil promovet,</hi> this doth move the Will, make men willing actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, only on condition they conſent, be willing and obey, and uſe it well.</p>
            <p>Firſt; This is a weak manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is to ſay it maketh men willing on condition they be willing, or not unwilling; that is, on condition they have no need of it, and that the work be done before it come.</p>
            <p>Secondly; This is to run them both into one, and make the preventing Grace the ſame with the ſubſequent. Thirdly; Yea, this is to deny all but the common Grace of giving the faculties (if it be proper to call it Grace) and the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak of the ſubſequent Grace. If a man uſe this preventing Grace well, will the ſubſequent certainly follow? You ſay, yea. Which of thoſe things above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med doth this belong to? Will this ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent grace only give them power of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Good, or make them actually to will it? If it only give them power to chuſe the good, this is the Natural faculty. Doth it alſo make them actually willing? you will ſay, That cannot be the proper uſe of this, for they are actually willing before; elſe they could not have uſed the preventing Grace well. Therefore you will ſay, this is to make them continue and perſevere, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105933:40"/>grow in actual willingneſs. But, will this keep them actually willing? You will ſay, No; not unleſs they continue uſing this Grace right, and that they do not, except they continue actually willing to uſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: That is, it will make them perſevere in chuſing Good, and refuſing the Evil, on condition they do perſevere chuſing the Good and refuſing the Evil; that is, on condition they have no need of it. And your ſubſequent Grace is alſo no more than giving the faculty and power, and the ſame with your preventing Grace. And ſo the total amounts to no more than this, If they improve that free-Will, without which they cannot be men, they ſhall be men ſtill while they live. You may apply what is here ſpoken to any effect that can be aſſigned to this Grace (while they will maintain only general Grace) as taking away reſiſtance, and unwillingneſs to Good; or cauſing a man to pray and ſeek after God. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed thus to repreſent to you that which is the Grace, that ſome other-wiſe Learned and Reverend men will only grant beſide giving the Goſpel.</p>

Whereas uſing this common Grace is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chief, prime matter. Oh but he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this power from <hi>God</hi> to uſe it? It is true; but yet a man that knoweth he hath done ſome good thing, or avoided Evil more than others; if he be of this opinion, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it was not therefore done by him; as, becauſe he received more from <hi>God</hi> than others, in the ſame circumſtances with him; but holds that he owes nothing here for any ſpecial <hi>Grace</hi> or help from <hi>God;</hi> for though that which <hi>God</hi> did for him was the cauſe, according to his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> of his goodneſs, &amp; differing, taken abſolutely, yet not at all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken comparatively in the ſenſe now in hand; it was no cauſe of the difference taken as a difference: take this inſtance, <hi>Two men had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual great ſtocks given them, one increaſeth his eſtate, the other prodigallizeth all away,</hi> if the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105933:44"/>reaſon be asked abſolutely, How one of them cometh to ſuch a great Eſtate, far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the other, <hi>the Stock given was a cauſe, and ſo thanks are due to him that gave it;</hi> but if the reaſon be asked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, why he differeth from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ows that to himſelf, and his good Husbandry, and not to him that gave him the Stock, no thanks is due here at all in this ſenſe; for this was no cauſe of, and ſo no thanks due for his differing taken comparatively, and not abſolutely, in which ſence I am now ſpeaking. And then if <hi>God</hi> did afterward do great things for a man, give him ſubſequent Grace (be it what it will) it was not from any peculiar favour or good pleaſure without reſpect to any thing in him, but becauſe he uſed the preventing general Grace (be it what it will) rightly, which others had in as great a meaſure as he, and did not.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105933:45"/>as not to any ſpecial Grace, which might juſtly have been denyed them, and was denyed others of like equal demerits) yet they do not, yea, account it would be their hainous ſin, and a deſerved forfeiture of this Grace, to expect it any other way. Let intellegent men reflect back &amp; conſider, whether all theſe ill Conſequences will not equally follow from the opinion <hi>of Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,</hi> which it is pretended Grace giveth, diſtinct from <hi>liberum Arbitrium;</hi> while it is ſaid to be given to all alike, and that God will do no more; yea, whether it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any way to avoid theſe inconveniences while men deny the whole deſign and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (though ſome may expreſs ſuch things leſs conveniently) of thoſe paſſages in the reformed Churches Confeſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Election and ſpecial Grace. I had rather that you gathered it of your ſelves, than that I ſhould ſhew it more plain.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105933:46"/>hope, however practically, by thoſe that yet oppoſe the motion of the Will by this Grace any other way, than by giving to all men a power of ſelf-determination upon this evaſion and pretence, that ſuch a power of ſelf-determination is given by Grace, diſtinct from, and over and above, that which is eſſentially neceſſary to a ſound man, and therefore, ſay they, in this we differ from <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and upon this account they deny it, becauſe to do any more than to give ſuch a power would be (ſay they) to deſtroy our humanity. Both which are meer aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without any cogent ſhew of proof that ever I could ſee, and the contrary is eaſily proved.</p>
            <p>Let us Remember we are but men, and <hi>God's</hi> actings are above our reach, yea, our own Souls-acts are ſo too. But <hi>God</hi> well underſtands his own actings and ours alſo; and what well conſiſts withour freedom and faculties, and what not, which may content us. Surely that man never ſtudied ſuch things, that ſhall pretend he can ſatisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decide all thoſe School-difficulties about our Underſtanding and Will, wherein there ſeems to be demonſtrative proof on both ſides. <hi>God</hi> hath given us knowledg enough of our Souls for uſe, but not to ſatisfie our curioſity.

And Objections here are very inconſiderable. It may be made plain to men of competent rational parts for ſuch things, that Gods knowing from Eternity what men will do in the variety of Circumſtances, is no more inconſiſtent with mans freedom, and no more difficult to be anſwered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, than Gods knowing the week or day before, what a free agent will do, would be inconſiſtent with his freedom and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and it is no more difficult to anſwer any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105933:48"/>objection made from Gods fore-knowledg, than it is to anſwer the ſame argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mans freedom, drawn from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>maxim, Quicquid eſt, quando eſt, neceſſe eſt eſſe,</hi> the ſame anſwer equally ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both. As for example: If one ſhould object thus againſt mans liberty to act and not act, to will and not will; He hath power both to will and not will ſuch good, either before he actually wills it, or when he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wills it; not before he actually wills it, for then he doth not will it; and when he doth not will it, it is impoſſible he ſhould will it: not when he actually wills it; for then he doth actually will it; and when he doth not will it, it is impoſſible but he ſhould actually will it; and therefore no man can have freedom of will, to will and not will at any time.</p>
            <p>This fallacious Argument may be ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that it is impoſſible to give any anſwer but this, That this impoſſibility <hi>ex hippotheſi,</hi> is not at all inconſiſtent with mans liberty, becauſe it is an impoſſibility poſteriour to, or after the acting or not acting, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature.

Do you think that <hi>Pauls</hi> turning from perſecuting Chriſtianity to it, was not commendable? <hi>Paul</hi> mentions it as well
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105933:50"/>done of him, that he conſulted not with fleſh and blood, but obeyed. And what wrong would this be to others; whil'ſt God doth enough for them; yea more then enough, did they not wilfully reſiſt it and oppoſe it? Suppoſe God had not done more for any, would they then have been inexcuſable in not turning from ſin to God? How then can this be poſſibly conceived to detract from their inexcuſeableneſs?</p>
            <p>And for any other difficulties whatſoever, it may be made apparent to any intelligent oppoſer, that they will no more encumber a man here, than they will in that difficult providence of giving and denying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And to make this out, conſider theſe things. Firſt, You uſe to urge theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures following, ſo as ſome think you build too much upon them, being not improbably hyperbolical, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Get thee to the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſpeak my words unto them, for thou art not ſent unto a people of a hard language</hi> (i. e. to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles): <hi>Surely had I ſent thee to them, they would have hearkned, but the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not hearken.</hi> Mat. 11.21. <hi>If the mighty works which were done among you, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</hi> So Mat. 12.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, this was denyed ſome places, that it is ſaid, had it been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, they would have Repented.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:105933:51"/>
            <p>Thirdly, You grant that multitudes are ordinarily ſaved, where the Scripture-light of the Goſpel cometh, that would have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed had it not come: and that God dealt, and dealeth not with every Nation for their Salvation in ſo high a degree as with the former Jews, and them that enjoy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You conſtantly grant, and it is expreſs from Scripture, that God knew they would not Repent to whom he ſent ſuch high means.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You affirm, God did not, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſend the Goſpel to ſuch places where he knew, had he done for them, as thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that Repented not, they would have Repented. This is neceſſary as a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-truth of your Fabrick. And I for my part, freely grant that a man may ſay, If God had not given me ſuch clear means as he denyed others, I had periſhed. And I dare not deny but that that height of means internal and external, which he uſeth with ſome, and yet it prevaileth not, would have prevailed with others, that more common Grace hath reſtrained and prepared.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, God fore-knoweth it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with all ſuch, with whom it will actually prevail; this you readily grant.</p>
            <p>Now there is as much granted in theſe your conſtant Confeſſions as I have ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God</hi> doth that in order to their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105933:51"/>for ſome, yea for multitudes, which he knoweth will prevail with them, that he doth not for others. Only I add this, And that without reſpect to any good thing in them. Now a man muſt be either very weak, not to ſee it, or very wilfull, not to grant it, That all the odious conſequences that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſaſtned on the Doctrine of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace delivered by me, may as truly be charged on that which you grant and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, except this be true, That this denying of the Goſpel is only to thoſe that are worſe then any that enjoy it. Which now cometh to be tryed.</p>
            <p>That learned worthy man anſwered Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> thus, about this thing (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his mind generally follow him in it) Thus, <hi>ad praedeſtinationis &amp; gratiae ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul ritatem adſtruendam, non magnopere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Iſthoc, eo quod illi contra quos diſputas, etiam ſuppoſitâ illius veritate, duplici tibi oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunrent ratione,</hi> &amp;c. that is, There may two things be anſwered here to avoid ſpecial Grace, and conſequently ſpecial Election, which follow thus,</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſaith he, the Reaſon why any are deprived of the Revelation of the Goſpel, is becauſe their parents, or Anceſtors rejected it (he means more than any other that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, or elſe it would be, as any one may perceive, weak Impertinency;) Now, to ſay nothing of the inconſiſtency of this, with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105933:52"/>other his principles, and how this would not avoid the force, if true, I anſwer, This is apparently not true. I will bring but one inſtance inſtead of many; How many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have been ſecretly ſtolen away, or by force and Armes taken away from Chriſtian Parents, and carried away, and Educated in dark Countries, though their Parents were far from rejecting the Goſpel, or however far from rejecting it more than others, whoſe Children enjoyed it? And leſt you ſhould reply yet, Some of their <hi>atavi</hi> or <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavi,</hi> their higher Anceſtors, were greatly guilty this way, I will ſuppoſe theſe very Parents had more Infant Children not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, and ſo all the ſame Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Or ſaith he, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy (he meaneth more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it than any that enjoy the Goſpel, as they confeſs that defend theſe words, and this opinion, elſe it would be Impertinent) of this great favour by miſ-improving Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light. But many were deprived of the Goſpel before they could miſ-improve their Natural Light, as in the caſe above-named, and the cauſe muſt be before the effect: And God giveth the Goſpel to many, not improving their Natural Light well. How contrary is this to Scripture, to ſay that the Jews had Gods Statutes and Judgments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe better than all other Nations? The Jews indeed were deprived of ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105933:52"/>becauſe of their ſin and unbelief; but the Apoſtle ſignifies to us, that the Gentiles were not taken in, becauſe better than they; elſe they might boaſt againſt them in the ſenſe he oppoſeth their boaſting. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were forbidden to preach to ſome where they found no oppoſition in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and were commanded to preach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places where they ſhewed themſelves unworthy. And to ſay, that yet they not long after preached in thoſe then prohibited places, avails nothing; for you will grant that many dyed in the mean time: yet while you ſay, that Gods denying the Goſpel to any, or denying the gracious help of his Spirit to any, is for their ſin and ill deſerts, I am far from oppoſing it: I heartily grant it, and it doth not in the leaſt oppoſe what I ſay, or help you, while you mean it only <hi>abſolutè,</hi> abſolutely; But if you ſhould mean it <hi>comparatè,</hi> comparatively, you ſee, or may ſee by what I have ſaid, it is not true. If a Prince take away the priviledges &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of one City for their Rebellion, and yet continueth the immunities to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City, equal in the Rebellion; If the Reaſon be asked abſolutely, why he took away the immunities of the City, and would by no means ſpare it, the Reaſon is, their Rebellion, their ill deſerts: But if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be asked why he took away their immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities any more than he did from the other
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105933:53"/>City, it muſt be anſwered, It was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſome ſpecial Grace or Favour to the other City was the cauſe of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>i. e.</hi> not for any deſerts, or leſs ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of that City ſpared.</p>
            <p>It is here commonly replied, Though it be granted that God doth give to ſome this way, a ſpecial benefit, without any deſerts that others have not equally that want the Goſpel; yet we deny that God doth it out of any ſpecial or greater Love to them, than he hath to others that enjoy it not. And ſo they ſuppoſe they maintain yet by this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (but it would not help if true) that God doth for the Salvation of all alike; but only wherein mans free Will (or which is all one as to the argument in hand, mans free Will equally aſſiſted by Grace) occaſioneth the difference; And they cite a ſaying of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> to ſhew they are not ſingular in this Opinion. But this evaſion is very harſh, and very offenſive to my Ears: for if bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits be not conferred out of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they would be only benefits materially, but not formally, and ſo no thanks would be due for them, no more than for benefits done to a man by another, without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dono'rs intention. And ſo if ſpecial benefits in order to a mans Salvation, ought to be apprehended to come, not from ſpecial Love and good Will; no ſpecial thanks could poſſibly be accounted due for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105933:53"/>them: and conſequently we are to account our ſelves no more bound to gratitude for the Goſpel, nor no more guilty of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in not improving it (what ever elſe we may be guilty of) than they are that want it.</p>
            <p>What ſtraits doth this Opinion of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpecial Grace and kindneſs bring men into? If the Goſpel ſhould by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God be ſent into one of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Countries, they muſt unavoidably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe principles, think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, We are either better than other <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> and God is bound to do ſo, or he would be culpably partial, and ſo would do the ſame to every Country as good as we: and ſo they cannot thank him for any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love or favour that he denyed to others as good as they; or they muſt think with themſelves, If we be as bad as others that want the Goſpel, we need not thank him for the Goſpel, as coming from any love or good will that he hath to us, more than to others that enjoy it not. So alſo the Jews anciently might have ſaid; and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably any Town that hath gotten a more powerful Miniſtry than formerly, Either we are better than we were, or than other Towns; or, if not, we are no more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him than they are that he takes not this pains with, and ſo no more thanks due from us than them. They ſay, Where the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105933:54"/>great Sultan's Horſe treads, no graſs will grow: I may ſay with truth, Where this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is held practically, no Grace will grow; and yet ſome maintain this with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, as ſeeing there is no way elſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſpecial Grace, and conſequently Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet this evaſion, if true and not abſurd, doth not at all take off thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that are pretended to follow from Election and ſpecial Grace, but they as much encumber your Conceſſions ſtill; and a wicked heart would ſay, I care not whether it be out of love or no, ſo that God do but that more for me, than others as bad as I, that he knows will ſave me: for if it be not out of love, I ſhall be freed from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch Scriptures as theſe be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to prove ſpecial benefits, and to prove them to be from ſpecial love, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial people unto himſelf, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not ſet his love on you, nor chooſe you, becauſe you were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but becauſe he loved you, <hi>cap.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Speak not thou in thy heart after the Lord caſteth out the people of the Land,</hi> ſaying, <hi>for my Righteouſneſs the Lord hath brought me to this Land.</hi> For the wickedneſs (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) of theſe Nations did the Lord drive them out; but not for the Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105933:54"/>or uprightneſs of thy heart, doeſt thou go into their Land. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand therefore</hi> (how he urgeth it as a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in Religion, to make them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!) <hi>that the Lord giveth thee not this good Land for thy Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> hath this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this place, as ſeeing it apparent hence. <hi>Prima Dei beneficia ſine meritis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingunt; illis, in troductio interram; nobis, ipſa fides.</hi> Which I cannot Engliſh better than thus, "God giveth the firſt benefits without conditions, and ſo giveth Faith or the Goſpel-condition without Conditions, though other conſequent benefits upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Now I doubt not, but when God thus urged this upon the people [<hi>Speak not in thy heart,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand therefore</hi>] as of great concernment in Religion, he would have been very angry if one ſhould have ſtood up and ſaid, as many now; God's love &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to every one alike, but only where Virtue or Vice makes the difference; and ſo God either doth not love you better than other people, or, if theſe benefits have love in them, then it is true, God doth not love us ſo as to give us theſe priviledges and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which he denyeth to other people, becauſe we were more than others, for we are fewer; yet (however for any thing we know) becauſe we are better; and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his good pleaſure, without reſpect,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105933:55"/>to any good or leſs-hurt in us: and it is true, It is not for our Righteouſneſs in a ſtrict ſence; but it was for ſome occult quality in us a kin to Righteouſneſs: For this would have been to have ſaid to God, I either know better than Thou or <hi>Moſes,</hi> or, if you know as well as I, you conceal your meaning to engage us more to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For though you ſeem to ſpeak largely, yet you have not made a ſufficient ennumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for it was not merely from ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love and favour not granted to others as good as we; but ſomething God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to, in us, better than in others.</p>
            <p>Again, when God ſaid, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>I have loved you ſaith the Lord,</hi> yet you ſay, <hi>Wherein haſt thou loved us? was not</hi> Eſau Jacob's <hi>Brother,</hi> ſaith the Lord? <hi>yet I loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau: that is, <hi>I preferred</hi> Jacob <hi>before</hi> Eſau. God ſpake this to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the Jews with unthankfulneſs, and to move them to gratitude, to love and honour Him as a Father. But one might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed here according to ſome, This giving to him and us his poſterity greater mercies than to <hi>Eſau,</hi> was not to love him and us, his poſterity, more than <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though you call it ſo; and ſo we can ſay for all this, <hi>Wherein haſt thou loved us, more than</hi> Eſau <hi>and his poſterity?</hi> or elſe, this was not from any ſpecial love to him and us, without reſpect to any ſpecial thing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105933:55"/>in him or us, that would not have been to <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, if as good as he or we; and therefore it doth not oblige us to any ſpecial obedience and thankfulneſs, more than them.</p>
            <p>They might have defended themſelves, That their ingratitude was no more culpable than that of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> had they been of ſome mens opinion, thus; There is only a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold love or good-will, antecedent Love, and conſequent Love, or good-will (which is a diſtinction,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <p>Chryſoſt. in Epiſt. ad Epheſ. cap. 1. hom. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Damaſcenus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, explain's more ſully this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
               </note> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and of good uſe, and ought to be taken notice of, to keep our notions clear; though I diſlike their ſaying, that the Antecedent love is equal to all,) The Antecedent love is that which hath no reſpect to any good in men, but doth good to all men, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any good in them; now this, ſay they, is equal to all men alike. I grant it, to all men; but am proving, it is not equal to all men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Conſequent Love, called alſo<note n="†" place="margin">If we conſeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give.</note> 
               <hi>Amor juſtitiae,</hi> being according to a Rule and Law; which Conſequent Love, or Love of Juſtification, is Conditional, and hath eſſentially a reſpect to ſome good thing in men, being by, and according to a Law, the Goſpel Rule. Now this, ſay they is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to all men alike, but where their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105933:56"/>or wickedneſs occaſion's the difference. And I readily grant this as apparent, That this Conſequent Love is to all men alike, as to the main and ſubſtance of it, and the effects of it, as they perform the condition or not; which is no more but this, <hi>He that is Holy, and ſo continues, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting</hi> Life, be he who he will, without any reſpect of Perſons; and, <hi>He that is more Holy ſhall be more Happy; even as he that is wicked, and ſo continues, ſhall be miſcrable; and he that is more wicked, more miſerable, without any exception of Perſons whatſoever,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how eaſily might they have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves, if the Antecedent-love was alike to all, you have ſeen already: And if this was to be underſtood, as Oppoſers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally would have it, of the Conſequent conditional love that hath reſpect to mans goodneſs or wickedneſs, they might have replyed, What though <hi>Eſau</hi> was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Brother, and ſo equal in that reſpect? Yet this is ſaid to no purpoſe; for they were of no equal good qualities, one was a good man, the other a bad; You would have been guilty of at leaſt not fair dealing, if you had not done for him more than <hi>Eſau;</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:105933:56"/>What an inconſequent manner of ſpeaking would this have been, to move them to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial thankfulneſs, to greater thankfulneſs than was due from <hi>Edomites,</hi> if he mean by Love, the rectoral and conditional Love, that hath reſpect to ſomthing in men.</p>
            <p>If a Prince ſhould ſay, when one Brother of many was Executed for Treaſon going on in his Rebellion, and the other Brethren ceaſed their Rebellion, and became Loyal, when there was an inviolable Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to all, on condition they would ceaſe their Rebellion, If he ſhould ſay, <hi>Was not he your Brother? And yet I have not hanged you all, what cauſe have you to be thankful in an eſpecial manner, that I dealt not with you, as with your Brother?</hi> They might reply, <hi>This of his being our Brother is nothing to us; we are indeed much ingaged to You for your general Love and favour, in making ſuch an Act of Oblivion upon ſuch an eaſie condition; but, that you did not Execute us as well as our Brother, is no ſpecial favour; for though he was our Brother, we performed the condition, and he did not; and, had we done as he, you would have Executed us alſo. You urge a fallacious argument to impoſe upon us ſpecial thankfulneſs, which is not due; It would indeed be right arguing if you meant by his being our Brother, our being and doing like him in every thing; but then it is not true; but if you mean by it</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:105933:57"/>only his being our Brother, it will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force on us any ſpecial thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>So if two Brethren have equal Stocks given them to trade with, and one hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved well by his induſtry, and the other is undone by negligence, what a looſe ſpeech would this be of the donor, Is not he your Brother? what cauſe have you to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of me more than your Brother? and how far more great, would your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be than your Brother's?</p>
            <p>What do theſe words here, Was not <hi>Eſau Jacob's</hi> Brother? but ſtand in the place of a ſufficient ennumeration, to fignifie that they were equal every way, but only where his love and eſpecial Grace made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? And how<note n="*" place="margin">I think it an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that Chapter, <hi>Rom. 9.</hi> that it doth ſpeak of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Love, <hi>viz.</hi> Vocation, and not of the Conſequent or Juſtification, from <hi>v. 9.</hi> to <hi>30.</hi> though yet I think ſome on the other hand, build that height upon it, that they have no foundation there, for; But I chuſe to reaſon from places &amp; things more obvious, as requiring fewer words.</note> Impertinently elſe doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alledg them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13?</p>
            <p>Now if it be once granted, that God doth any ſpecial Act of Grace for any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to any good in them, which he doth not for others; I ſee, you conſtantly and readily will grant, that he willed and decreed to do it from Eternity: For the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105933:57"/>
               <hi>Vorſtian Hypotheſes</hi> do not take with ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men. So that I think, inſtead of proving this<note n="*" place="margin">While a man holds ſpecial Grace, and the neceſſity of it, he holds all virtualy that <hi>I</hi> am moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to maintain againſt oppoſers; And I could favourably paſs by any errours in a man's notions about Election, that lightly he can hold, while he holds this. And I like well the moderation of thoſe Ancient Councils held againſt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſm, &amp;</hi> wiſh others would imitate ſo reverend a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, who all of them determined for Grace, and its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but none of them determined any thing about Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though then much controverted, as not holding that fundamental, but left that to be defended <hi>&amp;</hi> taught by the Orthodox Doctors of the Church, by ſtrength of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from Scripture and Reaſon, according to their beſt apprehenſions.</note> Conſequence; which is agreed on both ſides, I have more need, if this was a place for it, to tell people that, ſo they do but grant this Conſequence, it would be their ſin ordinarily to think of it in their ordinary duties, except in ſome few caſes, and it is their duty ordinarily to think of ſuch things as preſent, or as if they were to begin now, but this would require too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to explain.</p>
            <p>And further, to put the thing I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, quite out of doubt. Let any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man conſider, and he will perceive, that he that ſhould hold this opinion practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that the giving and continuing of the Goſpel, is conditional in that proper ſenſe that Juſtification and Salvation are; will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably run into ſuch miſchiefs, as I have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105933:58"/>before at large mentioned. He could not pray ſeriouſly, that God would ſend the Goſpel to places where their Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, or where they improve not well their Naturals; but can only pray in ſuch words, <hi>viz.</hi> that, God would ſend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the dark places of the world if they have not, or do not abuſe their Naturals; that is, if they be good; but not ſend it to make them good, while bad; And alſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray that God would continue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel where it is, but only that God would continue it to him and his, and the Nation or Nations, if they ſhall carry ſuitably to it. For a man cannot cordially pray, yea, it would be his ſin to pray, for that he holds God will by no means do, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in juſtice, becauſe it would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy reſpecting of Perſons, or becauſe God hath made ſuch a rule as he doctrinally holds he will not break; no more than he can pray that God would ſend the Goſpel to men departed this life in their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Unbelief. And alſo he cannot Praiſe God heartily for the Goſpel, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from any love to us that was denyed to others as good as he or we.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, it may poſſibly be in your thoughts to object that this difficulty may truly lie upon me, thus, Do not I pray that God would forgive great incorrigible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and yet I have affirmed pardon to be properly &amp; ſtrictly Conditional.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:105933:58"/>
            <p>Therefore <hi>I</hi> will anſwer this, though it require many words, and alſo becauſe in ſo doing, <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall make plain ſome things that confound ſome men; And <hi>I</hi> dare ſay, that they that do not keep ſuch Notions as theſe following, diſtinct, ſhall contradict themſelves almoſt in every word they ſhall ſpeak about ſuch things.</p>
            <p>God's Love, and Grace, and Mercy, is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſeveral ſenſes in Scripture. Firſt, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by it is meant, that Love in giving Chriſt a Ranſome for the world, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of ſinful men turned, ſhould Live. This Love, take it preciſely ſo far and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is to all alike common (though <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed, in another place, it is in ſome other ſenſe ſpecial) this Love is great Love indeed, and the greateſt in a ſenſe; for it is greater than any of the reſt taken ſingly and abſtractly, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Herein is Love,</hi> &amp;c. This Love is abſolute and not conditiona; he abſolutely gave him, <hi>that if men believed, they ſhould not periſh,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any believe or no, it no way leſſens this, being alien to it; though yet the great actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al benefit of it, is conditional. Again, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Love to all, in thus bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from under a neceſſity of periſhing by their ſins, yet they may be under his rectoral Wrath and diſpleaſure, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; yea, and all are ſo, till they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Believe.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:105933:59"/>
            <p>Secondly, Sometimes by it, is meant the Love or Mercy of giving his Ordinances, as to the Jews in the Scriptures before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; and the giving the Revelation of Chriſt in the Goſpel. Now, this Love is not common to all alike. And this Love is not conditional ſtrictly and properly; God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not tyed in juſtice and honour, neither having tyed himſelf to any certain rule or condition; though yet the deprivation of it, is granted, to be for mens ſins abſolutely (as <hi>I</hi> have explained it) and none can expect the continuance of it, that carry not ſuitablely to it. This Love alſo is conſiſtent with Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hatred, and being under condemnation. We may alſo pray that God would give this to people unworthy and wicked even while they are ſo, that it may turn their hearts; and may pray for the continuance of it to people neglecting and ſlighting it; becauſe, as <hi>I</hi> ſaid, is is left arbitrary to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That, called the Love, or<note n="†" place="margin">Illud ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcio quo modo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eatur, Fruſtra Deum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſereri niſi nos vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: Si enim deus miſeretur etiam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus. <hi>Aug ad Simpli. Lib. 1. qu. 2.</hi>
               </note> Mercy of Election, whereby God maketh people to differ, the Fruit of it being work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel-condition, turning men from ſin unto God. Now a man is under the Rectoral hatred of God, that is, is unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under condemnation, notwithſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Love, while you mean by it only Gods intention to convert him, yea, and till this effect be wrought, I mean, till after
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105933:59"/>in order of Nature though not of time: for a man is firſt Converted in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before he be juſtified, or have right to Heaven, which is the Rectoral Love.</p>
            <p>Again, This Love of Election is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, neither in the intention, nor effect, or Execution, in a proper ſenſe; though none can expect this effect, but in the uſe of the meanes, and God doth work this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by means, and men deſervingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to deny it by their ſin and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of means, Yet God having tyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to no uninterruptible rule, nor being tyed in juſtice, we may pray for it, for thoſe that neglect means, and ſeek him not, and have highly deſerved his denial of it. We may pray, that God would turn and change their hearts, before they be turned and changed, yea or have any deſire of this Grace.</p>
            <p>Again; But now that which is moſt properly called Rectoral Love, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Love, or juſtifying Love, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaving Love, is properly conditional in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, is tyed to a Rule or Law, and is a reſultancy from a Law, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething done by men; to wit, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their performing the Condition of the ſaid Goſpel-Law or Promiſe, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.27. <hi>The Father Himſelf Loveth you, becauſe you have Loved me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105933:60"/>and believed that, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.21, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. <hi>If any man love God, the ſame is known;</hi> that is, loved <hi>of him.</hi> But you ſee this Rectoral Love, or Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency is after our loving of him in order of Nature.</p>
            <p>This Love and Mercy of Election, the effect whereof is, ſoftening the Heart, or working the firſt Grace of Converſion, is not of him that willeth and runneth, but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mercy,<note n="†" place="margin">Haec gratia quae oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultè humanis còr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus divinâ largita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te tribuitur, à nullo duro corde reſpuitur. Ideò quippe tribui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut cordis duritia primitus auferatur. <hi>Aug. de praed. Sanct. Cap. 8.</hi>
               </note> namely this Mercy; that is, It is not to be aſcribed to mans chooſing Good of himſelf; but to this ſpecial Mercy that cauſed him to chooſe, will and run. But the Rectoral Love, the Love or Mercy of Juſtification &amp; Salvation, is of him that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, runneth, ſeeketh, ſtriveth; yea, and is of mans willing and running, formally; I mean only as oppoſed to it's being formally, as of Gods working it in us. Becauſe if a man did it without this ſpecial help of God that maketh, willing he would have right to Heaven, be juſtified. (It would here be great weakneſs for any to ſay, You muſt not make ſuch Suppoſitions; for ſurely we may ſuppoſe, ſuch things as a man hath a natural power to do, and that his heart reproaches him, for not ſo doing: I will only ask a man, making this Objection, this ſilly Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105933:60"/>Did your Hearts never reproach you for not being willing to omit that Sin which God did not make you actually willingly to omit?) Alſo, becauſe elſe you muſt ſay, there are no rewards; or, that God rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf and his own Act; which would not be ſenſe, no more than to ſay, Gods putting man into Paradice after he had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him, was the reward of his creating him: And alſo, becauſe the Promiſe is not made to God but to us, and not to God's Act but to ours: The Promiſe is not, If God work the condition in us, we ſhall be Saved; but if we repent and believe; this Law or Promiſe, and ſo this Rectoral Love, taking no notice which way it cometh, ſo it be but performed.</p>
            <p>We are not Loved with the Love of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection becauſe we choſe him, or (which comes all to one) becauſe foreſeen to chuſe him; No, in this ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that you ſhall bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit ſhould remain;</hi> that is, He choſe us firſt in this ſenſe. But yet we chuſe him firſt, chuſe the better part firſt, the way of Obedience and Life firſt (when he ſetteth before us Life, and Death in Good and Evil; and biddeth us chuſe his ways that we may live) I ſay, firſt in order of Nature before he chuſeth, loveth us, with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Love of complacency, Pardon Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:105933:61"/>
            <p>Now to anſwer the difficulty urged; ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving thus cleared my way. This Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goſpel-Law Love of Juſtification and Pardon is properly conditional, I mean as to the main ſubſtantial and great part of it, which is this; <hi>He that believeth ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have Eternal Life:</hi> For there is ſome leſſer part of this that is not ſtrictly conditional, wherein God hath ſo kept himſelf uningaged, that he may with ſafety to his Truth and Juſtice uſe a Liberty arbitrarily, and doth; as in Temporal Puniſhment, and Temporal Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And concerning this inferiour part, wherein God is left at Liberty, we may pray, God would pardon ſuch a wicked man though he continue wicked, as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Deſtruction, <hi>e. g.</hi> Relations may lawfully pray that God would not deſtroy his Eſtate, or take away ſuddenly his Life, though he continue wicked, they having ſome dependance on him; though yet they cannot pray that God would juſtifie him in the great things of Salvation though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wicked. And true Believers may praiſe God, for it is a ſpecial Favour, and coming from ſpecial Love denied to many as good or better than themſelves, that he doth not many ways make their Lives dreadful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, for thoſe ſins they were guilty of before and after Converſion: For this he might arbitrarily have done, and doth ſo by ſome ſincere Ones, But we cannot
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105933:61"/>rationally, or properly pray that God would give to a man continuing wicked, the full and moſt properly and uſually called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his ſins; for this is properly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and this God will not, yea cannot do, with keeping to his inviolable Rule; but it would be as irrational and unlawful as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead, To pray he would do it immediately before he hath made a Change in him. Though yet we may pray God, that he would do ſomething in order to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and we may pray that God would pardon ſuch in the ſence that Scripture ſometimes uſed the Word, as when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> he meant, They have highly deſerved to be deſtroyed immediately, and deprived of all Hope and Means; but do thou, even as they are, immediately pardon them ſo far, as to continue Meanes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to them, and ſtrive with them, and Convert them; and it may more remotely connote, after thou haſt done ſo, fully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them (<hi>leſt, they ſhould ſee with their Eye and be converted, and their ſins be forgiven them.</hi> Mark 4.12.)</p>
            <p>But he did not mean by <hi>Forgive them,</hi> the full pardon immediately: For this would have been to pray for the breach of the Goſpel-Law founded in his Blood. Again, a ſincere Chriſtian can praiſe God for ſpecial grace and favour in turning his Heart, and converting him while he was unconverted,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105933:62"/>and when he did not convert others as good, or better than he: And ſo, for his juſtification and Salvation, as more remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fundamentally coming from ſpecial grace, (becauſe the working the condition was ſo); but not formally. But he cannot in praiſing God, ſay, that God gave him his juſtification, pardon, right to Salvation by ſuch ſpecial grace, as that they were denied to others that were as good, or better than he was (I mean as truly converted as he) when they were conferred upon him. They can ſay, God converted them, before they were converted in order of Nature; but they cannot truly ſay, Juſtification and right to Heaven were conferred on them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, before they were converted.</p>
            <p>You can only now reply upon me thus; But though God do ſomthing ſpecial for the Salvation of ſome, which he doth not for the Salvation of others, as good as they, and ſo without reſpect to any good thing in them; yet he doth enough for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all. I heartily grant it, for I know you cannot in Reaſon mean any more than this, that nothing hinders any mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but their own wicked willfulneſs: For you cannot mean by it, God takes away every mans unwillingneſs, maketh every man actually willing, and chooſing the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part.</p>
            <p>I am ſo far from denying this, that I have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105933:62"/>endeavoured to prove it. You ſee it is my judgment, that none ought to do more than they can do; (taking Can in the ordinary ſenſe.) And if any amongſt<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>That ſaying of</hi> Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>would pleaſe me, had I aſſurance he meant</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, natura naturans,— Natura beatis Omnibus eſſe dedit ſi quis cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit uti.</note> Heathens had done what he could, in ſeeking and ſerving God, he ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Chriſt's ſake have been accepted with that little knowledg he could attain; or elſe, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, Comment <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Rather then he ſhould have periſhed, God would have ſent an Angel to Reveal further things to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ſhall yet reply, and ſay, But <hi>God doth Love and Will the Converſion of every one?</hi> I hold this as much at leaſt as you do: for you do not maintain that he is reſolved actually to convert every man, elſe every man (you ſay your ſelves) would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; But you hold that God giveth ſuch means through love to all, that if they did what they ought to do, and therefore could do, they would be Converted and ſo ſaved; and that their Converſion is commanded by him, and is amiable and deſirable to him; and that this is enough to denominate it a willing and deſiring the Converſion of all. If any deny there is any ſuch thing as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and willing in God properly and univocally ſo called, but only ſomething that we men cannot conceive of better than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105933:63"/>the notion of underſtanding and willing, and therefore ought ſo to conceive of it. I ſhould be far from oppoſing him. And <hi>I</hi> grant that this ſpoken of, is, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of by us, as a Willing the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all: and they that ſay, this is not to be conceived by us as a Will properly, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict expreſs Scripture, which is to be a rule of our Conceptions; and <hi>I</hi> dare ſay they do not conſider that what ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections they do, or can poſſibly, bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mens apprehending this as a Volition or Will, the ſame lye as much againſt what they do hold, (as any man may find by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little) that God approveth of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of them that will never turn, and their Converſion is amiable, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal offenſive and diſpleaſing to him. And <hi>I</hi> cannot ſee that you do thus far differ from your moderate oppoſers, except ſomtimes in words: for you diſtinguiſh thus (when you are to give the meaning of ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz. Who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> He doth whatſoever he will. God will have all <hi>Salvos fieri</hi> with an approving Will, but will not with an efficacious Will <hi>omnes Salvos facere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here only is the difference, you ſay<note n="*" place="margin">Certum eſt nullius Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendi.</note> God doth not with a preciſe Will, intend the Converſion of any man. And you mean by it, he intendeth not the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one man more than another, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105933:63"/>than by giving to all men, through love, power and means enough, and ſo leave it to themſelves, which is that you call the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Will. Now <hi>I</hi> and your moderate oppoſers differ from you in this: we hold that he not only willeth ſo far as you hold it, the converſion of all; but that he preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intendeth the Converſion of ſome; which we uſe to call a decretive Will, or the Will of Purpoſe, as we call that you agree with us in, the will of Precept; the object of one being Event, and of the other Duty. So that here is the difference, <hi>I</hi> do not hold that God doth leſs will the converſion of, or doth leſs for, or is leſs gratious to all, than you do, <hi>I</hi> abhor ſuch a thought; but only that God doth more will the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and doth more, and is more gratious to ſome in order to their Salvation than you do. Yea, <hi>I</hi> could (if it were worth while) ſhew, that <hi>I</hi> hold he doth more for, and is more gratious to all that live to years of diſcretion, in order to their Converſion and Salvation, than is conſiſtent with your Principles.</p>
            <p>And take notice once for all, that <hi>I</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the caſe of Infants and Ideots out of this diſcourſe, as being <hi>alien,</hi> and of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in Religion, and alſo difficult; and ſo either not to be ſpoken of here, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely to, than can ſtand with my deſigned brevity.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:105933:64"/>
            <p>If you ſhould yet urge that <hi>I</hi> hold ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing irrational: for, what though he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with all, do enough and more than enough for the Salvation of all, nothing hindering their Salvation, but their own willfulneſs, and he<note n="*" place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly; Though a Rational man in his firſt undeliberate thoughts would be apt to ſay, It is fit that all things ſhould be done alike to all, and that God ſhould make no difference, but where free Will makes it; yet theſe very thoughts do dictate equally, Let Gods government of ſinful men be in ſuch a way, as there may be no ſuch Prayers or Praiſes for our ſelves and others, for grace and holineſs, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtanced in, to ſhew this opinion would deſtroy them. But if all men being ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is apparent they are, we judg it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional as right reaſon doth (yea the reaſon of ſome Heathens hath) that we ſhould be ſuch depending creatures, as to pray ſuch Prayers, and to give ſuch thanks and praiſe for our ſelves and others, then it is moſt rational, yea, and eſſential to conſiſtency with our reaſon, that God ſhould diſpoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105933:65"/>of things in ſuch a way for ſubſtance, as they have been imperfectly deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that doing enough for all, there ſhould be ſuch an arbitrarineſs in God, in uſing ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace to ſome.</p>

            <p>If any ſhould object and ſay, You yet bring in the <hi>Stoick</hi> fate, or ſomthing like it. This was an objection againſt <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and you may ſee it well anſwered by him, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Bonifac. cont duas Epiſt. Pelag. cap.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledg, <hi>I</hi> cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what that Fate ordinarily charged on the <hi>Stoicks</hi> by the Ancients, was, nor how it was conſiſtent with their principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, except they excluded free-will from that <hi>ſeries implexa cauſarum,</hi> all of them that we have any remains of (worth the name of remains) being <hi>Seneca, Epictetus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> who are commonly charged (and <hi>Seneca</hi> truly) with being over great defenders of Free-Will.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105933:66"/>But it ſeems clear that they of them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ancients, <hi>Poets</hi> and others that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, held it upon this ground; that they might clear God of all things that ſeemed irreconcilable to Humane Wiſdom and juſtice in the Government of the World; So that when any thing ſeemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, they could ſay, He was, alas, bound by Fate and could not help it, and ſo was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh thoſe that charge others with holding Fate, to conſider if this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Principle be not like it, viz. <hi>That God doth as much as he may for the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every one, and that God could not in Juſtice have made</hi> Judas <hi>a Convert as well as</hi> Peter; <hi>elſe he would have done it.</hi> I grant, He is bound in Juſtice not to condemn any for not doing what they had not power and means to do; <hi>And he hath bound himſelf to ſave all Repenting and Returning Sinners, and none elſe; and ſo is here bound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſay, He may not do good, more good in order to ſome mens Converſion, who, if he did it not for them would periſh as well as others; or may not give the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to any, unleſs better than others that have it not; is to tye him where Juſtice doth not tye him, nor his Revealed Word; and wherein we grant every King, yea, and Man a Liberty; and would think it a miſs to bind them; &amp; is virtually to ſay, We may not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105933:66"/>pray for ſuch things for our ſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for he is bound: And it is ſuch away of clearing God as he would not be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, but he would rather have us confeſs we cannot anſwer ſuch Difficulties, as this Opinion is maintained to anſwer.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſpeaketh ſome-where to the ſame purpoſe. It muſt be from a ſhortneſs of diſcourſe for any not to ſee, eſpecially if he read that place, that <hi>Antoninus</hi> is againſt the opinion of them that hold, God will only give men a power of Willing Good &amp; Evil, but will not keep any men from willing Evil, or which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105933:68"/>is all one, not except they continue not willing it; nor will cauſe any to Will good any further, how-ever, not except they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Willing it, which is in ſenſe, if ſenſe, He will not do it at all.</p>
            <p>As for that which is ordinarily meant by Fate in this angry Charge, you may as truly be charged with it (though untruly) as your moderate Oppoſers: For you hold (whatſoever ſome little Retainers that know not your mind, or their own, ſay) that it is a known certainty to God from Eternity, who ſhall be Converted and Perſevere, and who not; and alſo that he hath decreed in particular, and <hi>in individuo,</hi> ſuch to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch to Condemnation upon this fore-fight, and that it will certainly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventually be ſo; not one Perſon more or leſs, eventually doing otherwiſe, and being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the end dealt with.

And yet theſe are Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and require a long and operous inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their conſiſtency. And ſome of ſhort heads will be offended at this your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105933:68"/>not underſtanding the Conſiſtency of it with mans natural Freedom of Will, and the Goſpel-Promiſes; or will make it like Fate to themſelves. It would yet be a falſe Charge for any to ſay, that according to your Opinion and Principle, what God hath decreed concerning mens future Eſtate muſt be, and cannot be otherwiſe, taking ſuch words in the ordinary Senſe; for though there be a Truth in this Charge, in a Senſe remote from the vulgar uſe of ſuch Words; yet according to the ordinary and moſt obvious Senſe of ſuch words, this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation is falſe; which is, that men have not Free-will to do good or not do it; or elſe; if they have, that they are concluded antecedently to the uſe of it, that, do what they can, turn to God, or not turn, their final Eſtate ſhall not be ordered according to their thus turning or not, which is falſe. And ſome it may be will undo, or have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done themſelves for ever, upon miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of your meaning, and their falſe Concluſions drawn from it.</p>
            <p>So here, <hi>I</hi> know it doth follow from what <hi>I</hi> ſay, that though God do enough (yea, and more than enough) for all, or will not condemn them for not doing what they had not Power and Means enough to do; yet if He do arbitrarily more for ſome, <hi>I</hi> mean arbitrarily as not being any way bound to do it, as having made no ſuch promiſe to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105933:69"/>them or others properly ſo called, though there are ſuch Intimations, commonly called half-Promiſes, that it is probable he may (though he may refuſe) make ſuch a man willing of unwilling, upon others pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in particular for ſuch as bad or worſe than others; and alſo ſometimes without any ſuch particular Prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for them; <hi>I</hi> ſay, it doth follow from this, that where he doth ſuch arbitrary things, he willed or decreed to do ſo from Eternity upon ſuch Prayers of others, or without them as the caſe is, he being Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Omnipreſcient.</p>
            <p>Yet people in going ſo high in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conceptions, would be very apt to make this like Fate to themſelves, as it is apparent they do that apprehend, as if ſuch volitions were not now as arbitrary to God as ever: For this is to deſtroy the right and true Conceptions of ſuch things, as are meerly done by him <hi>prolibitu,</hi> to think that he is by Decree bound, ſo as they are not now arbitrary.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as a man that is delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and thinking upon a return to God, muſt not go and conceive, It is a meer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary thing to God, whether he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to Happineſs or no; this would be an Errour: For God is bound, hath bound himſelf to receive him; and would have us conceive of him as bound by his Promiſe;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105933:69"/>and he muſt not go and think (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed true by both Parties) it is in a true Senſe determined by God, whether I ſhall be ſaved or not, he knowing whether I would return to him or no; but he ought to conſider, God is not at liberty upon my turning to accept or reject me; For he is bound by his promiſe, if I turn I ſhall live; and this Decree, or Will of God is well conſiſtent with this Promiſe, and I muſt make my Notions of the Decrees of God to give way to this Promiſe, and by no means make this Promiſe give way to them; For ſo far as my Notions of his Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this promiſe really, ſo far they are falſe: And that Notion about Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which men, verſed in ſuch things, can conceive conſiſtent with this, is built upon his high infinite unſearchable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and fore-knowledge, what I would do through my free-will only, or through Grace aſſiſting it.</p>
            <p>So when a man is Praying, or deſigning to Pray for a thing that is arbitrary to God, <hi>e. g.</hi> for the Converſion of ſuch a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as <hi>Monica</hi> for her Son <hi>Auſtin</hi>) he ought not to riſe ſo high as to think <hi>God</hi> hath decreed, whether he will convert him or no, in hearing my Prayer or no; and ſo though <hi>God</hi> be a gracious <hi>God</hi> hearing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and hath commanded me to Pray thus for him, and is apt to be moved with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105933:70"/>yet this Decree may hinder the ſucceſs of this Petition</p>
            <p>For this would be an erroneous Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to conceive his degree to be as Ill, and much like the Stoick Fate: For it is to conceive it is not now arbitrary to <hi>God</hi> to be moved with my Prayers; but it is to conceive though it was at <hi>firſt</hi> arbitrary to him, yet it is not ſo now, but he is preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and bound, and ſo it is to conceive ſuch a Decree as is ſomthing diſtinct from his preſent Will.

Ille ipſe omnium conditor &amp; Rector ſcripſit quidem fata, ſed ſequitur: Semper paret, ſemel Juſſit.</hi> Sen de provid. <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. Which is a very irrational Conception, leaning upon his Heatheniſh Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that things may now fall out to move
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105933:70"/>his Will that were not in his Eternal Willing foreſeen, or particularly apprehended, elſe they might move it now if at Liberty. And every one of our ſhort and finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings at the firſt notion, as ſoon as we hear or think of an Eternal Decree, are apt to have the like Apprehenſions, till our Reaſons pry a little more into it; as if His Eternal Thoughts and Willing, did not graſp and comprehend all theſe Prayers to be made, as being objected as clearly to him as preſent from all Eternity, to move his Will in the ſenſe wherein we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them to move his Will now.</p>
            <p>Let me adviſe all to take heed of ſpeaking or thinking of ſuch things as theſe I am now ſpeaking of; as if they were not free to Him now; as if they were not now to be done <hi>pro libitu;</hi> as if his Decree was once his Will, but is now ſomething we are to have a notion of beſides his preſent Will; as if the doing of ſuch arbitrary things was not now arbitrary; as if there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tyed him beſides his Juſtice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, beſides his own preſent moſt-free will. Take heed of that Notion, as if he was as much bound by Decrees, or as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as by Juſtice and Promiſe.</p>
            <p>But do you conceive of theſe things meerly of his Will, as being at preſent the free things imaginable, even altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as free to him as if they were to begin now?</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:105933:71"/>
            <p>I mean things of this Nature, that he is no way bound to do, unleſs you will ſay, bound by his Will and Decree, (which we cannot call binding, but in ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious ſenſe; as we ſhould ſay, a man that hath free Choice given him, is bound to do what he Will;) as in giving, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Goſpel to a People, wherein you are to conceive him ſo free as that he may, or may not be moved with your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for them, even as free as if to begin to determine now. And ſo when you Pray for a good Nights ſleep, which <hi>God</hi> may or may not give you upon Prayer; you muſt not think, It may be in vain for me to Pray, for he hath decreed I ſhall not have it: this is to hold<note n="*" place="margin">Deſine fata Deûm flecti ſperare precan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. <hi>Virg. Aen. 2.</hi>
               </note> Fate, and to think there is ſomething may hinder him from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Prayers, beſides his preſent Will, and it is to have unworthy Thoughts of <hi>God</hi> and to hold an Opinion, overthrowing all Religion, if held practically; and it is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to deny, this Prayer was objected before him in his Willing or Decreeing this Nights Sleep. Yet it is very hard when we go ſo high in our Thoughts, to get this Fate out of our minds.</p>
            <p>And therefore, take a man of the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comprehenſions in this World, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105933:71"/>cleareſt in his Notions about theſe things, and their Conſiſtency with <hi>Gods</hi> preſent Freedom; yet they are ſo intricate, and require ſuch Intention of the mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them conſiſtent, that it is his duty in Prayer for theſe arbitrary things, to apprehend and conceive as if <hi>God</hi> was now to begin to Will them: and ſuch Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are not falſe Apprehenſions, but only inadequate Apprehenſions; and that which the contrary Apprehenſion would immediately ſuggeſt into his mind, would be falſe, viz. <hi>That it is not now as arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him to be moved with Prayer, as if he was to begin to be moved with Prayer now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſhould object; What, may we pray to <hi>God</hi> as apprehending, as if he was to decree ſuch things <hi>de novo,</hi> to begin to Decree now? May we pray that he would change his Decree?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, You may, and you may not. Do but conſider, that by the Decree of <hi>God,</hi> you mean no more than the Will of <hi>God,</hi> and this may immediately call to mind, that you often pray to <hi>God,</hi> that he would do things which you fear he will do not, or doubt he will not do; and that he would not do things to the Perſon, Family, or Nation, you fear he is in Anger bent to do;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105933:72"/>this you do frequently, and yet do well.</p>
            <p>I grant you may not pray that <hi>God</hi> would alter his Decree, or begin to decree, in the notion that the Word Decree, is uſed by the cuſtome of ſpeaking on both ſides to ſignifie; for it is uſed by almoſt conſtant cuſtom, to denote the Will of <hi>God</hi> under the very Notion of Eternal, and ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth by common uſe the ſame that theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words <hi>[To will from Eternity]</hi> would do. Now if a man ſhould pray <hi>God</hi> to will in this ſenſe, or begin to will or change his decree in this ſenſe, it would be in effect, to pray in expreſs Words, and Formally under that very Notion, that he would not Will that now, he Willed from Eternity; which would not be only to pray, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Immutability, but to pray him to put off his Attribute of Immutability, which would be fooliſh and ſinful, and contrary to the reſult of our deliberate Conceptions, concerning his Eſſence.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105933:72"/>he will do ſuch arbitrary things, as we have ſome reaſon to fear he will not do, as when we pray for ſuch a wilful Sinner's Converſion; we ought to conſider <hi>God</hi> in this Duty (or we could not be ſerious and ſervent) as one that may, if he pleaſe, be moved with the preſent Duty; and we are not in our Addreſſes to conſider him, as one whoſe Will was to be moved, or the Requeſt to be arbitrarily denied with this preſent Prayer foreſeen from Eternity.</p>
            <p>It would be a weak pretence for any to reply; We pray only in Obedience, and not to attain the things prayed for; or to ſay, We do not pray to incline, or to move <hi>Gods</hi> will; or to ſay, We pray for the thing, but not to encline <hi>Gods</hi> will: If ſo, you pray only with your Lips, but not with your Hearts; it is to ſay, We pray for the thing, but not, <hi>ut velit,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> would do it; which is in effect to ſay, We pray it may be done without, or againſt his Will, or, We do not pray he would do it out of Love or good Will.</p>
            <p>As you are to conceive <hi>God</hi> hath a Will, or you would have ſinful Conceptions; ſo you are to conceive of <hi>God</hi> as being moved with his Peoples Prayers; and the contrary Conception to this would be falſe: For it would be this, That it is all one to <hi>God</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits, whether they pray or pray not, for the attaining of thoſe benefits: And
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105933:73"/>then if you conceive of God, as moved with prayer, you can conceive nothing moved by prayers, but his Will.</p>
            <p>I expect that ſome will yet ſay, You make God the Author of Sin and mens miſery; for if you hold that God doth more for the Converſion of ſome, than others, then you hold he doth leſs for the Converſion of ſome than others, and that he did not Will to do ſo much for them as others as bad as they. I would ſtop mens mouths, if poſſible. You muſt be ſo ignorant as not to underſtand what I have ſaid, or you muſt grant, that ſince I do not make him the Author of ſin, in turning ſome men actually from ſin, which is a contradiction, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make him the Author of ſin and mens miſery in thoſe Aſſertions wherein I comply with you, for I hold: He doth for all men, as much as you do toward their Converſion; I mean, ſetting a ſide the ſecond power which (becauſe I have a greater diſlike of, than I can expreſs) I will ſhew you it is nothing, but what <hi>I</hi> grant every man hath, <hi>viz.</hi> meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, or it is worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>And I will, if I can, make it very plain, that all may take heed leſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any fair pretence whatſoever, they ſhould aſcribe no more to Grace than

            <p>It is a Firſt-born of wonders to me, that ſo many learned men ſhould with confidence maintain that a man is not to blame, or not inexcuſable in not chuſing Good, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Evil, except he be made by Grace, through Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, having a Will as equally enclined to Good as Evil; which is, at leaſt, to ſay, No man ſins, or is to blame, except he be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man than ordinary. And it is the like wonder to me that they ſhould not ſee, The effect of the Grace ſpoken of in Scripture, and prayed ſo much for, and diſputed ſo much concerning theſe Controverſies, is ſomthing that men can poſſibly ſin without, can ſin though God deny it them: for we need not, yea, cannot rationally pray for it,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105933:74"/>to keep us from ſin, if we cannot ſin without it.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of wonders, take this alſo into the number, that thoſe learned men on the other ſide, that hold, that men can, and do ſin, and are to blame, though God do deny them that Grace ſpoken of, to keep them from ſin; that yet they ſhould deny that men in ſome true ſenſe can do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe without it: For this is to ſay, that all our Repentance is only for doing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we could in no ſenſe have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, leſt you ſhould ſuſpect that I ſpeak thus vehemently without reaſon, againſt this <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> that it is pretended Grace only gives; let me obtain leave to digreſs a little farther, to put you out of this ſuſpition. <hi>Tully de nat. Deorum,</hi> tells us of One argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, <hi>As giving Wine to ſick perſons often doth hurt, and ſeldome good; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is better never to give Wine to ſick people: So it had been better that Man had not been indued with Reaſon, becauſe it doth more men hurt than good.</hi> Now we can well anſwer this Objection; The compalint is unreaſonable, becauſe we had not been men without Reaſon; and, what hurt cometh to men by their Reaſon, is through their own default; and, much good might come by it, did they uſe it aright. But me thinks it may be made apparent, that that called Grace,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105933:74"/>which ſome will only admit, would, as they explain it, be really unlucky and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and no benefit can poſſibly be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to men by it. And becauſe I would not be over-large, ſo as to weary you in making this out, let me beg I may take theſe things for granted, and not be put to prove them; and I think I am not immodeſt in my begging. Firſt; <hi>That multitudes of men will periſh.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That all would have been ſaved eternally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſhould not ſin, or diſobey God in any thing; I mean, that there is no middle ſtate between Heaven and Hell for men.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That I may have leave to take their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of this general Grace, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and plead for it, without naming the Authors, who are many, and deſervedly much eſteemed in other things; and I will not mention by way of diſparagement any needleſly. Any one may ſoon ſee whether I ſet down their explications of it <hi>bonâ fide</hi> or no; yea, any one may underſtand that every one of theſe things following, are eſſential to it, to ſupport it, that it be not either needleſs to the making men culpable, and inexcuſable, that have the Natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; or meerly giving the ſaculties; or no way ſubſerving their deſigne, to avoid eſpecial Grace; that is, Gods doing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for one, in order to his Salvation, that he doth not for another, and that without
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105933:75"/>reſpect to any good in him. Now their Affirmations concerning it are theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Grace is given to all men alike. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> The Effect of this Grace is a thing, that men would be found men without; I mean, men in their right Wits, having the right Natural uſe of their Faculties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. For they affirm that to ſay, Grace only, giveth the Natural Faculties, would be <hi>Pelagianiſm;</hi> and deny they mean by <hi>Gods</hi> grace, this giving the Natural Power. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They call this, which I call the Natural Power &amp; the Faculties, the remote Power of Willing and Obeying, but they call that which grace giveth to all men <hi>Prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imam potentiam,</hi> a next, Proximate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to make men<note n="†" place="margin">Take notice I do grant, that they do ſay, this Grace is given to make men Actually willing, and they uſe to complain that they miſ-repreſent them that ſhould ſay, they hold that God doth not make thoſe Actually willing that are ſo: For he that giveth the <hi>Talent,</hi> doth in a true ſenſe cauſe the Improvement of it. But they tell us, They mean Grace giveth men Actually to Will no further than this common way, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a power of Chooſing or Refuſing: And if I have any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that may ſeem contrary to this, I ſo far wrong them.</note> Actually willing, and Actually to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Obey, but to give men a <hi>Prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imam potentiam,</hi> a ſecond next Power of Believing and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying if they would. The Effect of Grace is ſay they, to give a man ſuch Power as putteth him in <hi>bivio,</hi> in an <hi>Equipoize:</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him a more full ſecond Power of chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105933:75"/>Good and Evil; by this he is enabled more proximately to obey the Goſpel if he would. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They ſay, a man would have been in no fault in not believing and obeying the Goſpel, if <hi>God</hi> had not in Grace given him this proximate Power; he could not have ſinned in not repenting, or believing without this Power which Grace giveth, and that for this Reaſon; becauſe he could not but diſobey the Goſpel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and could not but<note n="*" place="margin">They mean without doubt materially; do that Act which is materially Sin without it.</note> Sin without it: And to ſay that he could do otherwiſe than ſin without it, ſay they, would be <hi>Pelagianiſm. Fifthly,</hi> They ſay, it is no ſin for a man to do a thing a man could not but do, or omit a thing he could not but omit.</p>
            <p>Now let any man, if theſe things be ſo, tell me, what this Grace (paſſively taken) this proximate Power, that Grace (Active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken) giveth, is good for:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> you cannot ſay to make them Men; for they would have been as perfect men without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You cannot ſay, That they might be enabled to Obey the Goſpel: For what Loſs would there have been to men if they had not Obeyed the Goſpel? There would have been, according to theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no need of Obeying of it, if this prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate Power had not been given: Becauſe they could not have Obeyed the Goſpel
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105933:76"/>without it; and ſo becauſe they could not, it would have been no Sin in them, no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience not to obey the Goſpel, though they had been ſound men. And to deny this would be to grant what I have proved; and what they oppoſe, That men are to blame in not doing what they have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties to do, though they have not this proximate Power of Grace: And alſo would make it needleſs for this end, <hi>viz</hi> To make them inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You cannot ſay that this Grace was needful that men might be ſaved; For they would be ſaved if they did not Sin, and they could not Sin without this Grace, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proximate Power; becauſe they could not but Sin without it; could not but Diſobey the Goſpel without it And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would have been no Diſobedience, or Culpableneſs, becauſe they could not do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and therefore all men would have been ſaved if this Grace had not been given, for they could not have been Condemned for no fault, and therefore muſt have been ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> You cannot ſay, But though they would not if this Grace had been deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been Condemned for Diſobeying the Goſpel; yet they would have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for breaking the Law: For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe Principles, they could not but Diſobey the Law without this Grace; and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105933:76"/>therefore it would have been no ſin in them to Diſobey the Law, and they could not be Condemned, becauſe they could not do otherwiſe than do it, and ſo they would have been ſaved.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, Your Accuſation is too high; for if this Grace be granted to do no good to men, yet ſurely it doth them no hurt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, according to theſe Principles if it be but granted, That ſome men will periſh; for none would have periſhed had not this proximate Power been given; becauſe, as they ſay, they could not have done otherwiſe, and ſo, as they ſay, it would have been no Fault, and <hi>God</hi> could not have Condemned men for it; and ſo there being no middle ſtate, all would have been without this Grace, ſound and perfect men here, and might have lived jolly and jovial Lives, and have been ſaved at laſt in Heaven.</p>
            <p>You cannot tell me, I cannot anſwer theſe Difficulties: For you have ſeen or may ſee, how this diſtinction of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Impotency,</hi> if admitted, doth unty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut all theſe Knots, by ſhewing; This Grace of theirs is needeleſs, for the end aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by them to it, <hi>viz. To make men inexcuſable by giving them Tower of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Power to Obey if they would;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105933:77"/>and that Grace which they deny, is neceſſary</hi> (in a right ſenſe) <hi>to a greater end, to make men actually willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could further ſhew you the Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with it ſelf, and the Contradiction to Scripture, and the<note n="*" place="margin">It might truly be ſaid, if this Opinion of theirs was true; That men can for any Impotency whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on them to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo live all their Lives, as not to need Pardon, or Chriſt's Satisfaction for any of their Omiſſions or Commiſſions.</note> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this Tenent, which yet is a Foundation-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſome Diſcourſes, viz. <hi>That the Impotency that the Scripture ſpeaks of upon men to any good, is not (to the immediate Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be performed) either upon good or bad men now, nor was then, elſe they had been blamleſs</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in not doing that Duty: but only it ſignifieth what would have been upon men, if that Grace through Chriſt had not taken it off from all.</hi> But I have ſpoken enough for them that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider words of Sobriety and truth, and too much for them that will not.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But whence came this</hi> Moral Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency?</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, What is that to you? (becauſe it is ſomething to you): but I will ſay, What have you to do to ask this here? For I am not now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, and you have no need to ask it for the Underſtanding of what</p>
            <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105933:77"/>
            <p>I have ſpoken; It can ſtand on it's own legs, without flying to that forrein, or more remote help; however I am reſolved to try it for a time, for ſome Reaſons. I anſwer, Firſt, It came not from God, he made man upright.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The Scripture teacheth you how ſin came into the World, and much is ſaid, and may be ſaid of that, to juſtifie God againſt mens accuſations; and much may be ſaid for our encreaſing it on our ſelves; But my buſineſs is deſignedly not to intereſt this diſcourſe in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Let it come which way it<note n="*" place="margin">Non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus unde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> will, you ſee it doth not excuſe, and ſo do all men, whatſoever they ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; You ſee, or may ſee (I ſpeak adviſedly) that there is no Impotency can hinder your Salvation, but what you may prevail againſt, if you would: for I have ſhewed you it differs not from the Will, not in <hi>ſpecie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take notice I have not at all denyed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Impotency on us (for I ſhould then contradict my own judgment) but only ſay, it excuſes ſo far as it hinders.</p>
            <p>There is much of Natural Impotency to many deſireable things, yea, in the beſt in this life, as a puniſhment, or product of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, and much as a puniſhment, or effect of our (in a ſtricter ſenſe) own ſins,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105933:78"/>
               <hi>e. g.</hi> many ignorances, and roving extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of the mind, melancholly, yea, and natural deſires or inclinations in the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the affections, which are not at all ſubject to the Will and underſtanding. And God may and doth heal ſuch things by degrees, by way of reward, upon prayer and endeavours of his people, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, help, and encouragement in their Chriſtian courſe; And alſo it may be, that repeated contrary-acts, and repeated deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, do in a natural way leſſen ſome altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther involuntary ſenſitive deſires. But theſe things, though done by God and his Spirit, may be matter of the promiſſory part of his promiſes, but not of the mandatory or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional part of them; however not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that is till thoſe impediments be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and in the mean time, we are to uſe thoſe means that we are to expect the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of them in. I do believe, that not only the rational part of the affections, and that part which is now ſubject to the Will, but the moſt ſenſitive part of them, was ſubject to the Will in <hi>Adam,</hi> before his Fall, and that he could not ſay, as we, <hi>I would not be troubled, or affraid, or put into a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, but cannot help it; I would have the more affecting and ſenſible part of joy, but cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now alaſs, if a man would as much as he can, without any unwillingneſs, many
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105933:78"/>ſuch paſſions cannot be cauſed, or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſome deſireable paſſions are cauſed, when our deſires and volitions of them, are leſs vehement; and conſequently, when we leſs pleaſe God in our duties, being more wanting in our duty and obedience.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a thing as Obligation and Duty growing upon us; that becomes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that was not ſo before, upon ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inward impediment removed by God's Spirit or otherwiſe; ſo that after, it would be ones ſin not to do, or not to do to ſuch a meaſure, things which before were not a duty, (however immediately) and yet things greatly deſirable, and their want to be lamented.</p>
            <p>But there is a preſent Obligation, and it is the preſent duty of every man that hath his faculties and an objective evidence, this day to perform the Goſpel condition, to conſent heartily to the obedience of Faith, and reſolve to hold on; and if he did this which he hath the Natural power to do, and ſhould dye, he ſhould be ſaved; elſe he might ſay, I would, and thou would not; and not only his duty to do ſomthing that may mediately and remotely tend to this, elſe we muſt ſay, It is not his duty this day to Repent and Believe, and he doth not ſin in not doing it; but only in not doing ſomthing elſe that may remotely tend to it. <hi>e. g.</hi> It is not this day a mans duty to read the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105933:79"/>Scriptures that cannot, and ſo not his ſin he doth not, though he had opportunities to learn and ſinfully loſt them; but only it is his ſin, that he doth not lament ſuch loſs of opportunities, and that he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and endeavour to uſe ſuch means whereby he may learn; and when he can read, it will be his duty to read. So if a man complain of diſtractions, and a ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered head and thoughts in duty, and that theſe came on him by his own former neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, we muſt ſay he is to lament theſe as an affliction and chaſtiſement for his ſin; but they are formally ſins only, ſo far as they do not diſpleaſe him enough, ſo far as his Will is not enough ſet againſt them; and it is not his duty to have his duties free from them, if his greateſt deſire cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; But it is his preſent duty to pray againſt them, and to uſe Gods means to be freed; and when they are once ſubjected by God, more or leſs to his Will, then it would be his ſin to have his duties torn, or ſo partly torne proportionably, becauſe then it cometh for want of preſent due care and watchfulneſs.</p>

Take this inſtance, ſuppoſe the Husbands of two Women are dead; one Wife, it may be none of the moſt loving, is exceſſive in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſorrow, the other a more loving
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105933:80"/>Wife is more compoſed, and cannot obtain of her ſelf that paſſionate ſtirring of grief. Now this is a ſure rule to go by, to judg who loved moſt; ſhe doth the more truely love, and more truly grieve that would give moſt of what is dear to her, to redeem his life. It may be one would give much, the other that hath overflowing paſſions but a little. If a man do Will and deſire God and things above, above all the world, ſo as to put him on all endeavours, this is the true rational Love, and would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, though he ſhould not have the more ſenſible paſſionate affective part: So if he have ſuch a real diſplicency and diſlike of ſin, ſo as he would give all the world to be freed from offending God; this would be accepted without the more paſſionate and ſenſible grief.</p>
            <p>But yet the more ſenſible part of the affections is greatly deſireable, and the want ordinarily to be lamented, and God giveth it as a reward &amp; ſenſible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his people. And it is without doubt wonderful difficult, and it rquires a great meaſure of Grace to keep the Will conſtant and reſolved, with full purpoſe of heart cleaving to the Lord, when affections have not theſe ſenſible taſts in paſſionate complacencies and meltings, which are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible encourageing ſmiles from above; I mean (for there may be great deceit here)
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105933:80"/>when in Conjunction with the integrity of the heart and Will. But the main thing we are to enquire after, and judg our ſelves by, is the appretiative part, the more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and rational part.</p>
            <p>Pardon ſuch expreſſions as theſe, which I have uſed, (partly careleſly, and partly for explication ſake, that I might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be underſtood.) He can Will it if he would, or he cannot Will it if he would, which hypothetical ſpeeches are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. You may indeed ſay of imperate acts that a man can do them if he would, or cannot if he would; But of the elicite acts that are no way imperated, you muſt only ſay, he can Will, or he cannot Will a thing ſimply: or he hath, or hath not the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or faculty of Willing the thing; or he hath or hath not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power, of Willing it. And I confeſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is not proper to ſay, A man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; perform the Goſpel condition if he would, but ſimply he can perform it: for it is in effect to ſay he can conſent if he would. But the impropriety here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently well hidden, by the variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the vulgar takeing of it as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from volition, as if it was rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated than elicited by the Will. Yet I have uſed ſome expreſſions (and I doubt not, properly) that ſeem to contradict this; as when I ſay, A good man would fain
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105933:81"/>draw on his Will further to Good, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Evil; that is, he would Will good more. But ſuch paſſages if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, do not, I think, contradict this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Let this be weighed a little; Any one that ſpeculatively conſiders his own Souls actings may perceive that there is not only a direct act of the Will, a direct voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is carried ſtraight forward, to its external object; but a reflex act of the Will, that hath an act of the will for its object; elſe a man could not pray for the willing of Good. A man may not only Will that which is Good, which is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect act, but may will and deſire, that he did Will and deſire ſuch a thing more; and this ſecond or reflect act is really a Will, a volition, being upon reaſons, and alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the other direct volition, having a quite differing object, and whether it be poſſible to go further with another reflex act terminated on this reflect act is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I ſuppoſe one may. But then (which keeps truth in what I have ſpoken) It ſeems the direct act of Willing is eſſentially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reflex; and that a man cannot Will he did Will ſuch a thing, till firſt he do Will it really, or (which comes all to one) he cannot, Will he did not Will ſuch a thing till firſt we have a direct averſation of his Will to it. A wicked man cannot remiſsly Will he did Will that which is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105933:81"/>Good (as it is granted he may) till firſt he have a direct remiſs Will to it: and if this was not ſo, it would object before us a moſt perplexing difficulty. Though yet to come to a meer ſenſitive appetite, a man may deſire he had it, though he have it not; or that he had it not, though he have it. So that this doth not contradict what was ſaid: for in propriety a man cannot Will a thing if he would, except he do Will it.</p>
            <p>And alſo I ſaid, an act of the Will, which is meerly elicited; But here (which is ſtrange) we muſt grant ſuch a thing as the Will imperating a volition, or <hi>quaſi</hi> impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating a volition, diſtinct from eliciting one. And yet this reflex volition cannot, I think, poſſibly have any imperated effect of its imperating a volotion immediately to increaſe the direct volition immediately; but only can encreaſe it by putting a man on the uſe of ſuch means as may encreaſe the direct volition. As for example, A man doth by this reflex Will for ſome good reaſons, will and deſire he did will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and love God and holineſs more; This reflex will though in its own Nature, and formally it comprehendeth more of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it doth not cauſe a man to love, deſire or Will God and Goodneſs more, with the direct act immediatly; but only it cauſeth a man to pray for it, and read and meditate on ſuch things as may encreaſe the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105933:82"/>direct volition; ſo that the direct act is not ſubject to the imperation of the reflex act at all immediately; but yet it is remotely; for the reflex act puts him on uſeing means to get a more clear, or more abiding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the worth and goodneſs of the object, to cauſe a higher and more practical dictate of the underſtanding, that the direct act of the Will may be thereby encreaſed; it excites and ſets that on work that can prevail.</p>
            <p>Let any one try if any uſe may be made of this, either to diſcover the prevailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and bent of the Soul more fully, or any other way. Any attempt of mine, I ſee, will be in vain here; ſuch things are too wonderful for me. What boldneſs is it for men that know their own Souls nature and acts ſo little, to pretend to know more of God and his actings, who curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought this Soul, than he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us?</p>
            <p>I ſhall account what I have here written loſt in part, if it have not ſome good effect upon the Readers in reference to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as well as intellectuals; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will add ſomthing by way of practical application, and hope therein to anſwer ſome objections that may yet be in your thoughts.</p>

               <p>HOw much to blame are thoſe that dread not Extreams? It is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with men, when once they are fully convinced that there is a dangerous errour on one hand, to be careleſs how far they run on the other hand, and to entertain an errour as dangerous, and maintain it to help againſt the other; though it may prove as incommodious to their Souls, as once our predeceſſors found it to the State, when they fetcht in the <hi>Saxons</hi> to drive out the <hi>Picts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us it was the great care of every Orthodox Teacher in his time,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de peccat. merit. cay. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> to take heed leſt they ſhould ſo defend Grace, as to deny free-will; and leſt they ſhould ſo defend free-will, as to deny Grace: and a good care it was.</p>
               <p>Some have ſpoken againſt Free-will to good in any ſenſe, have ſpoken without fear of over-ſpeaking of mans Impotency to Good, without any check or limitation; yea, and called it a Natural Impotency in the ſenſe explained; and however cuſtome hath ſo obtained, that the moſt underſtand it (without explication) of a Natural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, which to affirm, is virtually to lay
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105933:83"/>mans deſtruction at <hi>Gods</hi> Door, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſts Death and the Goſpel, and to clear Man. How ſad it ſhould be to us, that many have expreſſed themſelves in ſuch terms, (though they did contradict it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain virtually) that if wicked men had Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them (without doubt they had ſuch checks of Conſcience, that they did not) they might have encouraged their Hearts, as if their refuſal of Chriſt and Grace was not their Malignity and Wickedneſs; was not a Moral thing, but their Weakneſs, as oppoſed to Moral and Voluntary; a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs oppoſed to Wilfulneſs, or however different from it, a Cannot diſtinct from Will not; which every one hath a Notion that a man may be pittied, but not blamed for. If any ſay I have ſpoken thus, and held thus; but now ſee it is an Errour ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the very Foundation: but while I did hold it, I held it only Cloudily and Notionally, but I did practically hold the contrary, or I could not have Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others, or Repented of my former Sins: I readily believe you, and ſhall only ſay, Learn Charity to thoſe that differ from you.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome have ſo defended Free-will, that they have maintained, that <hi>God</hi> giveth to Men only a power of Chooſing Good and Evil, and will go no further with any. If any ſuch are ſenſible that Blaſphemhy to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105933:83"/>Spirit is written on the Fore-head of this Opinion, and that it makes the Spirits help, needleſs to a Man of ſound Intellectuals; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſufficient objective Evidence, and ſhall ſay, I held this only Notionally; for I did pray, which I could not have done had I held it practically: I ſhall ſay the ſame, I readily believe it, do you alſo learn Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould tell me I am too Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in granting that Men may hold Errors deſtructive of Religion, Notionally and Doctrinally, and yet hold the contrary Truth Practically. I anſwer, I know I am not, and any obſervant Man ſees it very frequent. If you ſhould reply, ſurely no Man holdeth Contradictions; quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opinions, however no judicious Man. Yea, I may confidently ſay, every judicious Man doth ſo, ſince every man in this World holdeth ſome Errours; and this may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, <hi>viz.</hi> If there be any man that you think you can truly Convince of an Errour he holds, you do equally think he holds Contradictions; Becauſe elſe you could not think you could Confute him, or ſo much as rationally Diſpute with him, if you did not think he agreed in ſomething with you, even in that which you will make your medium to Convince him, by ſhewing that his erroneous Opinion contradicts that which he agrees with you in. And you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105933:84"/>judge that he holds that Truth wherein he agrees with you far more diſtinctly and firmly; ſo that when you have manifeſted unto him that thoſe Opinions contradict one another, he will rather Renounce and Condemn (for no man can hold what he ſees a Contradiction) that Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than that Tenent wherein he agrees with you, and therefore he holds as you judge the Truth oppoſite to the Errour more firmly and practically.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ask me, Which Extream is moſt dangerous? I ſhall only anſwer, there have been many have conſtantly held this middle way for Subſtance, yea, the moſt have done ſo virtually; and they of them in extreams were in moſt danger that did leaſt contradict themſelves.</p>
               <p>And if ſuch an Incompetent judge as I, may ſpeak without offence (and why may I not, you ſuffer Fools gladly, your ſelves being wiſe) I would commend both, and blame both. I commend their Zeal in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on the one hand, for maintaining <hi>Gods</hi> Love to the World, and his willing the Salvation of all men, on condition they would turn to him. And though I blame their denying ſpecial Grace, yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the main Reaſon of their denial was, becauſe they were ſure there was ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grace, and none could Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding it in ſenſe; and they could not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105933:84"/>ſee it conſiſtent with ſpecial: and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this ſpecial Grace was not through any ill will to it, had they thought it conſiſtent with general.</p>
               <p>So I commend the Zeal in the other, in maintaining ſpecial Grace, but I blame their denying the general Grace. But yet am confident the main Reaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial was, becauſe they were ſure there was ſpecial Grace; and none could Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding it in ſenſe, while they deny it in words; and they could not ſee it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the general Grace; and their Oppoſitions to this general Grace was not through any ill will to it, had they thought it conſiſtent with ſpecial.</p>
               <p>But Sirs, are theſe ſo inconſiſtent, that you muſt either deny one or the other? For <hi>God</hi> to be ſo far willing of the Salvation of all, as to be willing to receive them on a condition, they have ſo far power enough to perform, that nothing hinders their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances but their own wilfulneſs; And to be ſo much further willing of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, as to reſolve to uſe effectual means to cauſe ſuch to perform it eventual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Is not the Scripture clear for both? And if we muſt meaſure Him by our ſelves, is it ſuch a difficulty that none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand? for one to be really willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a one to be his Servant, if he will upon ſuch ſufficient offers and perſwaſions;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105933:85"/>and yet reſolve he will go no further; and to be ſo willing to have another his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that he is reſolved to uſe all means to compaſs it. Suppoſe we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, may we deny in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoever we cannot underſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, as the Trinity in Unity. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that many things that were inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Difficulties in former, have in after Ages been made well Intelligible by Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men. How know you but had half that Pains, that Learned men have lately taken in oppoſing, been ſpent in reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diſtant Opinions about Grace and Free-will; That might ere this have been done more ſatisfactorily which I have here weakly endeavoured, and done but too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactorily to my ſelf.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105933:88"/>with deſponding trouble; but go on mourning over this remainder of unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs with tears of hope.</p>
               <p>What advantage may we take here, to comfort troubled ones, and to help them to keep up good thoughts of God! Many of them; through miſapprehenſions, are apt to think him a hard Maſter, expecting to reap where he hath not ſown, whereas it is not ſo. Many of them have ſuch ſtrong and ſenſible affections and inclinations to Good, that even their own Souls do bear that record of themſelves, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bare concerning others, that they are willing, even beyond their power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. and yet are afraid God will not accept of them in doing what they can; and ſo are greatly perplexed, becauſe it may be they have not ſuch tears, or ſuch freedom from diſtractions as they deſire and expect. But as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>If ſhe will not come, thou ſhalt be clear from this thy oath:</hi> So if tears and paſſions, and other ſuch things will not come, and that not from any want of your own will; you are clear in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, <hi>I am willing with all my heart to obey God in every thing.</hi> But this is a ſmall matter.</p>
               <p>I know, it is a ſmall matter in ſome ſenſe; but it is no ſmall matter in Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and this is no ſmall matter, if you
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105933:89"/>ſpeak of the original of it; It is a thing of high and noble diſcent, if you had rather have a good heart than a great Eſtate. The finger of God is here, The Father hath drawn. You have better thoughts than you would have, or than you ought to have of corrupt Nature, if you think this fruit grew on that Tree. Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaith with them, <hi>As for the words which thou haſt ſpoken, we will not hearken.</hi> They are Gods ſervants <hi>who ſo deſire to fear his Name,</hi> Nehem. 1.11. <hi>We ſhould praiſe God, and ſay, Who are we, that we ſhould be ſo willing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>I am willing, but I can do nothing, I do what I can in ſome weak meaſure, and would have it better, but my duties are blind and lame, and torne; I have done God much diſ-ſervice, but can now do him no ſervice worth calling Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. What ever thy ſins have been, and let thy ſervices be never ſo weak, thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs never ſo great, be thou never ſo unfit for thy Maſters uſe and Service, though thou ſhould'ſt be able ſcarce to ſpeak a wiſe word for him, or to him; yet, if thou doeſt what thou can'ſt, and deſireſt it was better, and endeavoureſt to encreaſe, this is enough for acceptance, as long as thou art thus willing.</p>
               <p>If a willing mind, he accepteth what thou haſt, and doth not require what thou haſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105933:89"/>not We read of a Maſter,<note place="margin">18 am. 30.13.</note> it's like ſome Captain or Officer, leaving his Servant a Souldier becauſe unfit for Service, <hi>becauſe he was weak and ſick:</hi> But the Captain of our Salvation is gracious; if we be ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to be unable to wield our weapon or follow him, yet if we follow him as we are able, and reſolve in his ſtrength to do what we can, and never to turn Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Turn-coats; this ſheweth we are true to our Captain, and he will not leave us and forſake us, we ſhall receive pay.<note n="*" place="margin">Greg. Moral. Lib. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Deus non reſpicit quantum homo valet; ſed quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum velit.</hi> God looketh not on the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or outward extenſion, but on the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity &amp; inward affection. The deſire of a man (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>is his kindneſs,</hi> not the weight or worth of the gift. <hi>The Widdow</hi>'s <hi>Mite</hi> was accepted, being her <hi>All</hi> in upright de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the reaſon ſhe caſt in no more, was for not want of Will, but ability; becauſe ſhe had no more. Yet it may be a queſtion, whether all ſimply, or all that was not juſt neceſſary for her ſuſtenance; but it is moſt likely all ſimply, and then it might poſſibly be her failing, and againſt the duty of care of her ſelf; and though there might be ſuch imprudence, yet God taketh no notice of it, being in the integrity of her heart. As if a man ſhould loſe opportunities from worldly advantages imprudently, through love to God to attend his Service, God
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105933:90"/>would accept it while it was in the Integrity of his heart, according to the beſt of his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do but endeavour to Love and Eſteem Chriſt more, and admire Free-grace more, and never fear your natural Weakneſſes as oppoſed to Moral. It is not the outward quality of the Perſon, or outward Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the duty commends us to <hi>God</hi> but the Heart. You need not envy others A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; ſerve <hi>God</hi> in your places accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Abilities. Miniſters of weak Abilities and Parts, are as acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> while there are competent miniſterial Abilities; yea, more acceptable, when there is more of Deſire and Endeavour to do good, than Miniſters of greater Abilities; and often more ſucceſsful. Greater Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are apt to puff men up; it is hard to give much, and not let the left hand know what the right hand doth. So, hard to be extraordinary in any Duty, and keep hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let Devils and Wicked men ſcoff at Weak, but Willing Miniſters; and ſay, (What will theſe feeble people do?) as they did, theſe are but poor Builders. But we Read, <hi>The Wall was Built, for they had a mind to work,</hi> or a heart to work, <hi>Neph.</hi> 4.6. So ſuch as have a heart to build, may build ſo as to reach Heaven themſelves, and build up others for it. <hi>God</hi> will ſay as <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jonadab, If thy heart be as my heart, then come into my Chariot</hi> of Glory.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:105933:90"/>
               <p>Yet when I ſay <hi>God</hi> requires the Heart and Will, I do not ſay only but principally, and yet ſo only that if a man could do no more it would be accepted. If he have the Heart, all other things required follow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ordinarily, and if they do not it will be excuſable: For then the defect is a <hi>cannot.</hi> If the Heart lead, all that have no Impediment follow. All the Members, and Powers, and Faculties in a man, ſay to the Heart and Will, as the People to <hi>Joſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> Cap. 1. v. 16. <hi>All that thou commandeſt us, we will do, and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us we will go, only the Lord be with thee.</hi>

That is, be not perplexed, as if ſome difficult im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing was required of thee now to Salvation, that thou canſt not perform if willing; this is to deny Chriſt's Death and Aſcenſion. What did he dye for, if ſome impoſſible thing be required of us notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Death? Men will entertain none, nor give wages to any, but to thoſe that can do much, to thoſe fit for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. When to hire a Servant, a Maſter asks, What canſt thou do? If a Servant ſhould anſwer, I can do nothing, I have no Skill or Ability, I have not been uſed to work; but I am willing, I will do what I can: Who would entertain ſuch a Servant? But if any ſhould ſay thus, and that heartily to <hi>God,</hi> I am very unfit for any good Work, I have not been uſed to do any Good, but I will now do what I can; if I fail, it ſhall be my greateſt grief, and againſt my will. <hi>God</hi> will accept it; this is all that he requires to obtain the great Wages. Oh Riches of Grace! <hi>Is this the manner of man, O Lord?</hi> 2 Sam. 7.19.</p>
               <p>The laſt Invitation to Sinners in Scripture is this, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come, and take of the Water of Life freely;</hi> Which

               <p>HOw humbling may this Doctrine of mans Ability and Power (in this right ſenſe) to good, be to us; Yea how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is it to a right Humiliation? And how influential to make the World guilty before <hi>God,</hi> that we and they could have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, not only in <hi>Adam</hi> (as ſome weakly ſpeak) but when we ſinned? Do not ſay, This diſcourſe lifteth a man up. Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt ill uſe of it, if it have ſuch an effect on thee; it is to glory in your greateſt ſhame, it is like being ſet on fire, with having Water poured on thee. No Doctrine can poſſibly tend more to the debaſing and humbling of men. This ſhould abaſe us in our own eyes, and ſtain our pride; for it demoliſhes, and even pollutes all our Sanctuaries of Refuge. Many are apt to ſay, Alas, What can we do? What can poor fallen Creatures do? Do you blame us? Our Diſability is only true, in a ſenſe wherein it may lay load on us; and in that ſenſe wherein we are a ſhamed to own it; but not in the ſenſe wherein it may excuſe.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, This Doctrine taketh off too many things from being ſins: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks others might anſwer for me, that if the man be in an Errour that way, yet he ſeemeth to recompenſe it, by laying grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105933:93"/>load then ordinary on thoſe, which all agree to be ſin.</p>
               <p>We are wonderful prone to fly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; yea, and to ſuch excuſes as would lay the fault ultimatly on God: but this lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us naked to our ſhame.</p>
               <p>But if any will ſay, It is not from wicked willfulneſs that they continue in their ſins, let this try. I call you this day, ſaying with <hi>Jeremiah, Jer</hi> 18.12. <hi>Return every man from his evil wayes, and make your wayes and your doings good.</hi> Now what will you Anſwer? Either you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we will with all our hearts do what we can, and then God will accept you, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in this; or you will anſwer, as they in the following verſe, <hi>We will walk after our own devices, and we will every own do after the imagination of his evil heart;</hi> or as they anſwered ſuch a call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. <hi>As for the word which thou haſt ſpoken unto us, in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee: But we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of our own mouth,</hi> &amp;c. You ſee you have no colour to pretend it is from a weakeneſs, diſtinct from voluntary wickedneſs. And if you will yet go on in your neglect of God and his wayes, whereas Chriſt ſaid; <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> I might be provoked to ſay, Father forgive
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105933:93"/>them not, they know what they do. But God forbid I ſhould ſo ſay; God was wrath with <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſpeaking unadviſedly with his lips, when he ſaid, <hi>O ye Rebels!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You that have a deſire to fear God's Name, and in the main are a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did you think it was from want of will to do otherwiſe, when you committed any known ſin, or omitted any known duty? Did you think you had ſo much wilfulneſs left, and ſo little Will to thoſe things you have a Will to, and complain of the neglect of? and ſo much Will to thoſe things you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the doing of? When you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſinful weakneſſes, are you not apt to think of them in ſuch expreſſions as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural weakneſs, and not as being in part wilful wickedneſſes, though they are ſo far as formally ſinful?</p>
               <p>Some have ſaid (but I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true) that <hi>Omne voluntarium eſt involuntarium,</hi> that every voluntary act is in part involuntary. But we may ſay it of almoſt all, if not of every of the duties we perform; Cry out, oh our wilfulneſs to evil! Oh our wickedneſs! Oh our unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to good! Thoſe things we have a Will to, we have but little Will to. How many duties do we perform with a half-heart, and with a ſinful indifferency? who counts it their meat and drink to do the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will? Chriſt went more willingly to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105933:94"/>ſuffer for us, than we to do any thing for him. When we are doing God's Will, how ſeldome can we ſay, We delight to do thy Will? we go forward it may be, and dare not turn back, but how often like <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife do we look back? we go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like thoſe kine that carried the Ark, lowing as they went; we do, and ſuffer for God, murmuring, repining, <hi>dicis gratiâ</hi> as the phraſe is.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall reply, You ſeemed to grant that a man caſting his goods over-board to ſave his life in a Tempeſt, cannot but do it in part unwillingly. <hi>No man can with his whole will</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>thus caſt a way his Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer; I grant it is ſo in ſuch a caſe, becauſe the man in that caſe is to be a great loſer, and to have no reparation. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Merchant had been required to caſt away his goods to ſave his own life, by a Prince that had given him thoſe goods, and all he had beſide; And one able and willing, and faithfully promiſing to make up that loſs; yea, promiſing that if he caſt them away, he ſhould be recompenced an hundred fold; would it not then be ſtrangly irrational to caſt away his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, murmuring, and with ſuch an half Will? Was your obedience and ſelf-denyal required by one that had never done much for you, and was there to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105933:94"/>no reward of your ſelf-denyal, I could not tell how to anſwer you in ſaying, How ſhould we but deny our worldly and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt, very unwillingly? But when God hath done, and Chriſt done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, ſo great things for you, and made ſuch promiſes; then to do duties repining, and like that Paſſenger in the ſtorm that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> repreſents, who caſt away his goods <hi>multa mala precans &amp; Superis &amp; In inferis,</hi> What a ſhame is it? We ſhould ſay as the people, when they offered ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Of thine own have we given thee, for all things come of thee;</hi> and ſhould ſuffer with joy the ſpoyling of our goods, knowing we have in Heaven a more enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and rejoyce we are counted worthy to ſuffer for his Name. But Did not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> go more willingly to offer up his Son, than we our ſin? He aroſe early in the morning to go about it, we put off.</p>
               <p>I grant, In the ſenſe I have before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, a good man would do more good and cannot. But yet this is a great truth, and is to be the great charge againſt your ſelves. That you can do more good than you do, and will not; You can avoid more evil than you do, and will not.</p>
               <p>Friends, though God will pardon you while there is a willing mind in the main, notwithſtanding your great unwillingneſs, while your willingneſs is the prevailing,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105933:95"/>countenanced bent of your Soul; yet you muſt not pardon your ſelves. Pardon not your ſelves in this unwillingneſs, as you would have God pardon you.</p>

               <p>He calls the men of <hi>Judah</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to judg between him and his Vineyard; and, by his Vineyard, means the ſame Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So that <hi>God</hi> hjere appeals to the Men themſelves againſt themſelves, which he would not do, if he did not know that he had a Compurgator within them, that their Conſciences muſt reſtifie for him againſt themſelves, that they had all things naturally neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Now, you I am ſpeaking to, judge you. You are it may be apt to ſay, If God had done his part, I had done mine. <hi>God</hi> hath done his part, ſo as there was nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105933:96"/>at firſt to keep <hi>adam</hi> from falling, that he ought to have done.</p>
               <p>But to let this go, and to take things now as they are in this degenerate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Hope brought-in a ſecond time; there is nothing now wanting on His part, that you may lay your ſecond Periſhing on him, and not on your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Many are apt to think or ſay, we will juſtifie <hi>God</hi> becauſe we fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> but take things as they now are, and he hath not done enough; things are not brought a ſecond time to our choice, elſe we and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not ſo gone on in our ſins, and therefore, if we do ill, let him blame himſelf and not us.</p>
               <p>Do not now fly to other Countries, or ſuch as cannot underſtand what is ſpoken, I could ſpeak ſomething of them; But my buſineſs is to you that hear, and can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I ſay. And I ſhall ſhew you that he hath ſo done enough for you, that if he had done leſs for you by many parts, or not waiting ſo long; yet you could lay your Periſhing no-where but on your ſelves. <hi>God</hi> hath done a great deal more than he needed for you, to make you inexcuſable in periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>Now bring forth your ſtrong Reaſons, What ſhould he have done more? <hi>What Iniquity have you found in him?</hi> Jer. 2.5. And if I can eaſily anſwer you, how eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105933:97"/>can <hi>God</hi> and your own Conſciences;</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>If you ſhall ſay, There is ſomething beſides wilful refuſal in mens periſhing: For this ſecond periſhing cannot be laid on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that periſh, for Chriſt never dyed for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this was ſo, I confeſs neither I nor any elſe could anſwer you. But Chriſt hath ſo far Dyed for you, as by his Death to obtain this, <hi>That if any man turn he ſhall live;</hi> and this law of Grace is made in his blood. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 7.25. No man ſhall ever be Condemned becauſe no price was paid for him; but only for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing that which was purchaſed for him, on the Terms whereon it was offered. The Scripture no where layeth the periſhing of Sinners, on the want of a price paid for them; but every where on their refuſal. <hi>You will not come to Me that you might have Life.</hi> Theſe Words imply that there is Life enough in Chriſt for you: and if you miſs of it, it is becauſe you will not have it. If Chriſt had ſo left out any, that he had not purchaſed, <hi>That if they believe they ſhall be ſaved;</hi> then you might charge miniſters with Falſhood, as well as you might if they ſhould Preach, If the Devils ſhould repent and believe they ſhould be ſaved, whom Chriſt never purchaſed this for.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:105933:97"/>
               <p>Would Chriſt bid his Miniſters Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. if it was not true? Would he bid them make ſuch Offers, and invite ſuch multitudes of Gueſts, if he was not ſure there was Proviſion enough for them all? Elſe this ſhould excuſe, and they might ſay, If we periſh this ſecond time for want of a Saviour, it is no fault of ours; this would be their Miſery and Calamity, but not through their refuſal of Mercy that they periſhed. You might elſe ſay at leaſt, There is ſome other Reaſon why men fall ſhort of Happineſs, and not only becauſe of their unbelief; Nay, their unbelief would be no reaſon at all of this Periſhing: The not taking Phyſick was no reaſon at all of a mans dying at ſuch a time, if it would not have ſaved his Life if he had taken it, no more than his taking any thing elſe, that is acknowledged to have no tendency to his Health. And it is in vain to ſay, For any thing, they knew, they might have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; or, They and others thought in the judgment of Charity, (as ſome ſpeak) that if they had believed, they might have been ſaved: for this is nothing, if the Truth was otherwiſe; and at laſt in Hell they will know the Truth was otherwiſe, and then not befool themſelves for not doing it.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:105933:98"/>
               <p>Suppoſe a man thought a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would have ſaved him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought ſo too, but in truth it would not; Can you ſay, if he did not go, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed becauſe he went not that Pilgrimage? And will he befool himſelf when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it was to no purpoſe to have gone? If a man could perſwade them in Hell, Chriſt never Dyed for them, never purchaſed for them, that, If they had turned they ſhould have liv'd; he would take off a great part of their anguiſh by perſwading them not to befool themſelves for refuſing Grace and Mercy. The Rich man in Hell is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that Expreſſion, <hi>Send Lazarus to my Brethren,</hi> as one that thought that men on Earth, that are in danger of going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that will do ſo, if they go on, may prevent their coming thither. And when <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwers, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> it implyeth his thoughts, that men have all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and nothing is wanting towards their Salvation but themſelves.</p>
               <p>This of Chriſt's dying for all ſo far, is ſo apparently proved by Scripture, by almoſt any that have attempted it, that could any of ordinary abilities obtain of themſelves to read ſuch, they might eaſily be ſatisfied: So that I think I may ſay, He that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this, let him be ignorant ſtill for me.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:105933:98"/>
               <p>The only colourable Objection (that is not virtually anſwered in what I have ſaid) that I can call to minde, is only from <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world;</hi> Therefore ſurely (ſay ſome) he would not ſhed his blood for the world, for whom he would not pray. But would any be at pains to read that Chapter, he may ſee that Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelf, what he did in that particular prayer at that time: And that particular prayer to <hi>verſe</hi> 20. was only for the Apoſtles; or at moſt for them that were then actually believers. And <hi>verſe</hi> 20. he prayeth for them that ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward believe through their word; and ſo all that he prayed for there were actually Believers, or looked on as ſuch; and the ſubſtance of the petitions there can agree to none elſe, as keeping them in truth and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is not one word in that prayer for God to cauſe any to believe: ſo that we may as well argue he never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Converſion of any, becauſe he did not in that prayer, and ſo never ſhed his blood for the Converſion of any. But can any think that Chriſt that wept over <hi>Jeruſaem</hi> never prayed for it; or that there were none but Elect that Crucified him, when he prayed for his Crucifiers. May we not with greater reaſon argue contrary thus. Surely he did at other times, though not in this particular prayer, <hi>pray for the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105933:99"/>world, ſince he ſhed his blood for it.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objections are reduceable to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one, That it would be no kindneſs to dye ſo as to purchaſe for any, but the Elect that actually would believe, <hi>That if they believe, &amp; turn, they ſhall live;</hi> becauſe none elſe have the Natural power to turn, to perform the condition, but they that he actually cauſes to turn, and ſo it would be but to mock them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant if this was true, it would be but to mock, as to ſay to a Lame man, If thou wilt run, I will give, (let his lameneſs come which way it will); but you ſee men have the Naturall power to perform the condition; and though they will fall ſhort of the benefit through their wickedneſs, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it was no kindneſs: and cannot any one ſee, it would as much follow according to your way, that, it would be no juſtice in God to puniſh men for not performing the Goſpel-condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj. Some may ſay, But there is ſomthing beſide Will in it; for Natural men cannot underſtand the Goſpel, and Scriptures, and Will of God; Carnal men cannot know, them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to trouble you with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation that ſome make very probably the meaning of one of theſe places.</p>
               <p>Firſt; The utmoſt that can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105933:99"/>to be drawn from theſe and ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is; Either that they could not know ſuch things by their reaſon, except they had been revealed to them by the Scripture; or that Natural men do not love or approve and ſavour the things of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly; If it was ſo that men Could not underſtand his Will, this would excuſe, and God would never require ſuch to know and obey his Will. As for example, If the Scriptures were written in ſuch a Language as you could not underſtand, and none that could would tranſlate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them to you; or if there be one that is a fool, and hath not the Natural power to underſtand what is obvious in them, or if you had the competent uſe of Reaſon, but the Scriptures were written ſo obſurely, that you could not with your greateſt endeavour underſtand them. <hi>I</hi> do believe there are ſome things ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in Scripture, that no man can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. Now though it be deſirable to underſtand ſuch things, yet <hi>I</hi> do not think it a mans fault he doth not, and ſo not his duty: But only ſo far his ignorance of them is ſinful, as it cometh for want of Will, and ſo of Induſtry. Nay further, I do not think that every man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that great pains whereby he might underſtand thoſe difficult paſſages, which yet he might underſtand with great paines:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105933:100"/>but only ſo much (ſuppoſing he have a competent knowledg of what is neceſſary) as is well conſiſtent with his other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scriptures are plain in the great things neceſſary, and have been made ſo plain to you, that either you do or might have underſtood them. One once ſaid to a Lady that was maintaining the Scriptures were to be neglected, becauſe difficult to be underſtood; Madam, What can be plainer then this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery?</hi> They are ſo plain that young People may underſtand them in things neceſſary. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> underſtood the Scriptures from a Child. <hi>A Young man may cleanſe his way by taking heed thereto according to this Word.</hi> They are written to give to the Simple, and young man, Knowledg and underſtanding. There is none of you here but it is likely you know ſo much already, as would you be faithful to that little, and endeavour after more, <hi>God</hi> would accept you.</p>
               <p>Let me ask every of you, Do you not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Repent hereafter, and turn to <hi>God,</hi> and Chriſt? If not, thou art a more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wretch than ordinary; if thou do, thou confeſſeſt by that, that thou knoweſt what is the main required of thee; and yet art ſo in wicked thou wilt not yield.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are you not <hi>willingly ignorant of</hi> ſuch things? Like thoſe 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. Such
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105933:100"/>as do not like to retain <hi>God</hi> in your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg? ſuch Fools as hate Knowledge and Inſtruction? Such as ſay, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways.</hi> Such as thoſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5. <hi>Who know not, neither will underſtand. God</hi> offers you the help of his Spirit, and Miniſters, but you refuſe. Your Ignorance ſo far as it partakes of Will is formally Sinful, ſo far as you do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough diſlike it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But are you indeed ignorant and cannot Read? I will not ſay it is your Duty this day to Read, becauſe you cannot: But it is to be lamented as a Fruit of ſin that you cannot, if you had opportunities to Learn, and loſe them careleſly. Yet it is thy Duty to Learn to Read; if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably attainable by thee, by the help thou canſt get in the Circumſtances wherein thou art. But ſuppoſe it not probably attainable by thee, ſo that a prudent man would think it not thy Duty to endeavour it. Get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Read to thee, and uſe ſuch means as a man would uſe that hath a willing mind to Learn, and do his Maſter's Will; and be Faithfull to the knowledge thou haſt, and it will be accepted. How many have gotten a good Knowledge that could never Read? How many are now in Heaven that could never Read? Without doubt, the greateſt part of them in Heaven could never Read, when we conſider how few could Read in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105933:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Primitive times of Chriſtianity, yea, and till almoſt this Age.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>But I cannot turn from ſin to God, I cannot leave my ſinful wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou be one that ſpeaks this by way of Excuſe, as the moſt do that uſe this ſpeech, being one that goeſt on in thy ſins notwithſtanding rebukes; <hi>I</hi> dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, thou Lieſt, when thou ſayeſt <hi>I</hi> cannot in the propereſt ſenſe of the word, and in the ſenſe wherein it can by a rational man be brought to excuſe; that is, if thou mean any thing elſe by it, than <hi>I</hi> will not; Thou ſhouldeſt, ſay as the Truth is, <hi>I</hi> will not. If thou ſay, <hi>I</hi> cannot will it; either thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt falſly, meaning <hi>I</hi> have not the Natural Faculty; or <hi>I</hi> can anſwer, The more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inexcuſable Wretch thou! For thou meaneſt, <hi>I</hi> will not Will it, <hi>I</hi> chuſe <hi>I</hi> may not, <hi>I</hi> will not for all that <hi>God</hi> and Man can ſay to me, my Wickedneſs is ſo great. Would'ſt thou ſpeak plain, it would appear to thy ſelf and all the World to be no Excuſe, and this makes thee hide thy meaning in dark Words. Speak out plainly, and this is it, <hi>I am reſolved to pleaſe my Fleſh and Senſes, come what will of it. I have ſuch a choſen Averſneſs to God and his Wayes, and ſuch a Love to the wayes of ſin, that though the Miniſter ſhould lift up his Voyce like a Trumpet, and ſpeak and ſound as terribly as the Trumpet will at the laſt day, I will go on.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:105933:101"/>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>But I really would leave ſome ſinful wayes and cannot, and would do better and cannot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would ſpeak here warily. If thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be only this, I would do ſuch things, and would have ſuch graces, if I could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them without much Trouble and Self-denial and difficulty to my Fleſh; or I have ſome ſudden unconſtant deſire of ſuch things, ſometime ariſing from ſome ſudden Paſſion or extraordinary Occaſion; or I have ſome little velleity, ſome motions of the will, but theſe come not to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced prevailing Choyce and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But notwithſtanding all theſe, the prevailing bent of my Will, and that which I moſt chuſe, all things conſidered, is to go on and pleaſe my fleſh: If this be all thy meaning, I may ſay, So hath any, or almoſt any Thief or Robber to leave his courſe of Life, and would do it, could he but tell how to live in ſuch, or ſome little leſs, competent Eaſe or pleaſure as he eſteems this courſe affords him without it: But ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, his prevailing will is to follow on his courſe.</p>
               <p>But if thy meaning be, It is the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent of my will; my darling choyce is the better part, ſo as that it is my greateſt grief that I fall ſhort. I had rather have a good Heart then the greateſt Eſtate. And though I be frequently guilty of many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105933:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Commiſſions (though not of very groſs ſins): Yet there is no ſin but fain I would overcome it, and no Duty but I would fain perform it; ſo that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements: <hi>God</hi> will accept this. If one ſhould ſay, as I heard one that was much in that Duty once complain; <hi>I would Pray, but the Words are taken out of my mouth:</hi> If this ſhould be really ſo, that it do not proceed from want of will, <hi>God</hi> would accept it without words. But take heed of deceiveing your ſelves: If there be a Will in the prevailing degree, the Deed will follow if there be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Opportunity; elſe it is but that which we call Wiſhing and not Willing in the ordinary ſenſe. If thou art real, thou doſt perform the Chriſtian Duties in ſome weak meaſure, and lamenteſt thy perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them no better. A real prevailing Will is accompanied with Holy Endeavours, and earneſt ſtrivings in the uſe of meanes. Do not deceive your ſelves, <hi>God</hi> will not be mocked; He will try whether you be real or no. Say as <hi>Jacob, My Father will feel me, therefore I will be carefull I ſeem not to him as one that mocketh, leſt I bring on me a Curſe and not a Bleſſing.</hi> I cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict you if you ſay, I would, but cannot, of many things in this ſenſe; I can only ſay it is true in <hi>Theſi,</hi> if a prevailing willing mind be preſented, <hi>God</hi> will accept what ever fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105933:102"/>there are beſides. I can only give you rules how to try whether this be the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bent of your Soul or not, and would do it here more largely, but for ſwelling this Diſcourſe too much.</p>
               <p>Obj. 5. <hi>But there is ſomething elſe in it than my wilfulneſs; for God doth not give me grace to Repent, and turn from my ſins to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you mean he doth not give means e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough naturally neceſſary to work this change, I have ſhewed you it is falſe: <hi>God</hi> giveth thee abundance of objective Grace through Chriſt, as, his Goſpel-Promiſes, Threatnings, and alſo many helps and motions to leave ſuch wayes and turn, ſo that nothing is wanting but thy own will.</p>
               <p>But if you mean, as you ſeem to do, that <hi>God</hi> doth not actually prevaile with you to leave your ſins, this is very true, if you do go on in your ſins. But may not every Thief and criminal Offender ſay the ſame, <hi>God</hi> did not give me grace to leave theſe courſes. But will this excuſe before any wiſe Judge?</p>
               <p>Obj. 6. <hi>But God could turn me if he would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very true. Any man that committeth any ſins may ſay, <hi>God</hi> could if he would
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105933:103"/>with his efficacious will, have hindred me from that ſin. Yet we are ſure, this doth not excuſe; it was not therefore no Fault, no ſin becauſe he did not; elſe there could not poſſibly be any ſin in the world. You ſee many going on in all Villany, <hi>God</hi> could turn them if he would, but do you think they are in no fault becauſe he doth not? <hi>God</hi> hath wiſe Reaſons and ends why he will not with ſome go any further, but ſets bounds to his Will. You ſeem by ſuch an Objection to wiſh, He would rule you as <hi>Bruits,</hi> in a natural way not conſiſting with Promiſes and Threats, with Rational and Moral government of rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Obj. 7. <hi>Then he doth not will my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Salvation, or that I ſhould abſtain from ſuch a ſin, if he doth not actually Convert me, or actually hinder me from ſuch a ſin, ſince he can.</hi>

               <p>But your Converſion is amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105933:103"/>to him. He will be able to ſay of them that periſh, I would and you would not; and can you rationally demand the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World ſhould do any more, what-ever he may do arbitrarily to ſome?</p>
               <p>Obj. 8. <hi>But God doth give Grace to ſome as bad as I, and ſome way that I know not of makes them willing of unwilling.</hi>

               <p>I grant he doth ſo. But ſuppoſe he did not, would'ſt thou then be inexcuſable? How can this then alter the caſe? Would it excuſe all the High-way men in the Land, if the King ſhould ſome way extraordinary prevail with one or more, not to go on in ſuch courſes?

This, all ſides diſown: The utmoſt that is pretended by any moderate men, about this we are now ſpeaking, is, That there is a poſitive Decree to permit ſome to undo, or not hinder them from thus undoing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this I ſhall not deny, but wiſh them, that are better able to Judg, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſince ſuch Conceptions are only to help our Underſtandings, that our imperfect Notions may be in ſome meaſure rationally conſiſtent) Whether it be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and ſo to affirm any ſuch poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to permit; whether a conception of a meer Negation of a VVill in him to hinder, a not decreeing to hinder, be not enough: For you uſe to found this Poſitive decree Not to hinder, upon his fore-ſight of what men would do if not hindred; now if they would do it without, and antecedently, to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105933:109"/>ſuch a poſitive Decree, what need is there? nay is it not to conceive a vain poſitive Act, to affirm ſuch a poſitive Decree to permit that which men would do without ſuch a poſitive Decree to permit, if he do not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively decree to hinder? But to let this paſs, and ſuppoſe ſuch a poſitive Decree (he giving men means enough, and more than enough) not to go any further in hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from going on in their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p>How comes it about, that men make ſtops and Exceptions about the Decrees of <hi>God</hi> in reference to their Soul-concernments, and never make ſuch queſtions about them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concernes, wherein Learned men that differ about theſe things, ſeem better agreed about poſitive Decrees? Men Plow and Sow, and never queſtion whether <hi>God</hi> hath decreed, whether there ſhall be any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. When yet <hi>God</hi> hath reſerved to himſelf a liberty here, and may, for any thing they know, blaſt all their Corn, and doth ſometimes (and therefore decreed it) notwithſtanding their good Husbandry. Yet none here ſaith, I will neither plow nor ſow; for if he have decreed a good Crop, I ſhall have one, if not, I ſhall not have it; But this ſatisfieth men here, Though <hi>God,</hi> it may be, will blaſt all, do what I can; yet <hi>God</hi> uſeth to ſucceed diligent Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But here, in the caſe in hand, you
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105933:109"/>have far more reaſon to be confident: For <hi>God</hi> hath reſerved to himſelf here no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to blaſt at all. All agree in this, that none ſhall fail, or not find who heartily ſeek, and ſo continue; nor ſhall ſo chooſe, and purſue this better Part, and miſs of it. <hi>He that cometh to him, he will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All agree, that there are no Decrees but what are well conſiſtent with the Truth of theſe Promiſes, and all Notions of Decrees really inconſiſtent with ſuch Promiſes are falſe: As alſo all thoſe Notions of Decrees that are not conſiſtent with his threatnings, as, He that repenteth not, ſhall periſh. But one may perceive how it comes about, that men fly to Decrees here, and not in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concernments. Men are more hearty for worldly Concernments; but have a mind to go on in their ſins, and would fain find out ſome excuſe for their ſloth, and to lay the fault on <hi>God</hi> that they periſh.</p>
               <p>But it would be a wiſer, and eaſier courſe, <hi>To be making your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> than be making Objections from ſuch things as you do not underſtand, to hinder you. You in vain expect to be carried to Heaven, or to eſcape Hell without diligent Endeavours of your own.

Do you think God is angry at you for not turning to him this day, and can you think it would not be better for you to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105933:110"/>turn, or that he will not receive you if you do thus turn?</p>
               <p>I dare conſiderately ſay upon good ground from Scripture, you can go this day, and do that which would be accepted of God. I do not ſay, you can go this day and ſo rejoyce in God and his ways as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or that you can have ſuch paſſionate and ſenſible workings of affections as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or that you, that have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, can perform duties in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as others, though you was never ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; &amp; if ſo, I dare ſay, it is not your duty at preſent. But you may do that this day, which would be accepted by God, would you do what you can this day in obedience, and reſolve by Gods help to go on, and never to turn aſide, and God will cauſe thee in time to be more Chriſtian like; And if for thy former great ſins God ſhould never make thy life here ſo comfortable as others, yet if you thus cleave to the Lord, with full purpoſe of heart, as one reſolved as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man in integrity, that wherein you have done iniquity, you will do ſo no more; and that you will not live in the neglect of any known duty, but will do what you can in every thing, with the utmoſt of your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and continue thus doing, you ſhould be ſaved.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105933:111"/>drawing. And therefore if you do thus Will, and do actually, it is from this drawing of the Father, and from the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous operation of the Spirit, not only giving the power, but ſome way cauſing the very act Willing of diſtinct from giving the power of Willing and nilling, which every ſound man, I mean every man in his right Wits, hath.</p>

               <p>If I maintained, as ſome do, that God only giveth men the Power of Willing and Nilling (let it come from Nature or Grace, that makes no difference in the caſe) and that this is that Power, without which men could not ſin, or, which is all one, could not be inexcuſable in not turning to God, and that God did not, nor ever will go farther with any that are, or ever were converted; This would indeed be to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that you have no Impotency in any ſenſe, but that you can for any Impotency whatſoever Repent and turn, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ever did turn, and alſo that this you will have conſtantly while you are a man bound to repent and obey the Goſpel.

Some may be almoſt willing, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the prevailing degree, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſome are willing to part with many ſins, but it is not yet their prevailing will to part with all. Some again are almoſt willing to give up themſelves to God in every thing, but there is an aeſtuation or fluctuation of their Will, are waveringly willing, off and on; but are not come to a point, to the ſettled firme choyce and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is only the prevailing bent. This drawing of the Father is frequently thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually; at firſt a more wavering willingneſs is produced, &amp; at laſt a more fixed and ſetled.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Pride not your ſelves, nay, reſt not ſatisfied as if ſafe, for you are not, in ſuch begun willingneſs, in your willingneſs in part to do ſome things, yea many things as <hi>Herod,</hi> yea all things like that young man in the Goſpel, who went away ſorrowful, as having ſome little willingneſs to what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but not a prevailing choice. But yet own and bleſs God &amp; his Spirit for ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, if you deſire they ſhould grow and increaſe. Know that theſe come not from
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105933:112"/>your own wicked hearts of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Deſire others to pray for you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Pray for theſe things as you are able.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; Meditate much on ſuch things as may make you thus willing; The vanity of the world; Excellency of God; the Love of God and Chriſt; what he hath done and ſuffered for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly; When almoſt willing, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly willing, endeavour to engage your ſelves, to tye your ſelves faſt. It is Gods way, and you may expect his bleſſing on it, ſo to engage your ſelves as you may ſay to temptations, <hi>I have opened my mouth, and cannot go back; I have ſworn and will perform.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly; Let all take this advice. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on his Ordinances. <hi>He gives the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, while</hi> Paul <hi>plants, and</hi> Apollo <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> Zach. 14.16. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever will not come up of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the carth to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to worſhip the King the Lord of Hoaſts, on them ſhall be no rein.</hi> Keep in his Church, this is the way to expect raining on. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>

It lyeth more eſpecially in the influences of the Sun, and there fall the watering ſhowers of Grace. It is a fearful thing to run away from his walks; And to get out of the reach of thoſe weapons which are mighty through God. Do not ſay, Let ordinances alone till men be converted, let Reading, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Praying alone. <hi>Faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord</hi> (even in the glaſs of the Goſpel) <hi>we are transformed into his Image by the Spirit of the Lord. God opened</hi> Lydia<hi>'s heart in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Paul, Act. 16.14. <hi>She heard us, and God opened her heart to attend to the things ſpoken.</hi> Let even them come that attend not; God may open their hearts, as hers, to attend and conſider. They are ſaid to reject the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to comply ſo far as to be baptized of</hi> John, Luk. 7.29, 30. <hi>It is a deſireable thing for men to, and dreadful for them not to, frame their doings to return unto the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 5.4.</p>
               <p>Now upon a Review of what I have ſaid concerning <hi>Natural and Moral Impotency,</hi> I add this. It would not much diſpleaſe me for any to deny what I have ſaid in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:105933:113"/>further then my great deſign in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which is to ſhew that men amongſt us have no Impotency but the Moral to the performing the Goſpel-condition. Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man enjoy his own thoughts for me, that thinks there may be ſome Natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency that doth not excuſe from ſin, ſo he do but grant there is no Natural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency on us to the performing the Goſpel-condition, that is, to the doing what muſt be done, or we undone; for he deſtroys not by ſuch an opinion, the Goſpel-grace, ſince he held there is a remedy brought to mens choyce. Though yet if he grant it true of the Goſpel-condition, I think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he go as far as I have done, his notions will not be poſſibly conſiſtent. And let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man alſo differ about what is ſaid of them that enjoy not the Goſpel, ſo he do but grant there is no Impotency on us that enjoy it (but what I have mentioned) that can hinder our Salvation: for this is of leſs concernment to us. And theſe are both things that I would have excluded out of this diſcourſe, if <hi>I</hi> could well have told how, and have kept up a conſiſtency of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of the greateſt moment to our ſelves.</p>

            <head>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> to the Diſcourſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Moral Impotency.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Impotency</hi> I ſaid nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of the traduction of Sin, and that deſignedly as reſolving to Speak only of things that I thought I could Speak Satisfactorily about, and knowing I ſhould Speak leſs Satisfactorily concerning that as both oppoſite parties ſeem to do, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially knowing that it would be no way helpful to clear the great controverſies there ſpoken to; becauſe, one ſort of Impotency, come which way it will, doth excuſe, and the other not; and ſo the difference of them lieth not at all (whatever hath been preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contrary) in one ſort coming one way, and the other another, but in the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference of their Natures; now becauſe of this ſuppoſed neglect, ſome that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to object (ſo far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) pretend as if nothing was ſaid except. I ſpeak of this thing wherein both differs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and which I never yet ſaw fully clear'd to my mind, and wherein I can puzzle my ſelf. I ſhall here only mind ſuch of thoſe things that I have thence made more fully apparent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I have made this, or nothing, apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> That that ſort of Impotency which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a man would excuſe from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obedience that he hath the Impotency
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105933:115"/>to, if he did not bring it upon himſelf, I ſay, that ſort of Impotency would excuſe equally from ſuch future obedience if a man did bring it upon himſelf, as Lameneſs, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, want of an object, yea, all natural Impotency as I have explained it.</p>
            <p>Yet take notice, that when I ſpeak of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Impotency excuſing though a man bring it upon himſelf, I only ſay it excuſeth from future Obedience. For I grant that by bringing it upon himſelf, he may be ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively to be guilty of all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent failings of Service and Obedience that follow upon making himſelf ſo Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. As an Apprentice or Servant that voluntarily<note n="†" place="margin">Like the <hi>murci</hi> or <hi>Murcenarij,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers that <hi>Anntian, Marcel. Lib.</hi> 15. Speaks of, that <hi>Cut</hi> off their <hi>Thumbs,</hi> that they might be freed from material Service, called, as he faith, <hi>Joculariter Murci.</hi>
               </note> Lameth himſelf, or maketh himſelf drunk, and ſo diſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf for his maſters Service, is not only formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of wounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or drunkenneſs (as he would be was he <hi>ſui juris,</hi> and not Servant to any man,) but is alſo in ſo doing interpretatively guilty of the following neglect of his Maſters ſervice and commands, that he by ſo doing renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Impotent to perform. Only I mean he is ſo far made excuſable in his following neglects, that we cannot ſay he is guilty of a new fault in not ſerving his Maſter when he cannot, and it would be irrational in his Maſter to be angry at him or puniſh him,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105933:115"/>only for his former fault in making himſelf ſo Impotent, but alſo for his not ſerving him when he knows he cannot. For the whole malitia or culpability of ſuch after diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is to be aſcribed only to the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabling himſelf, becauſe he did or might probably foreſee that ſuch loſs to his Maſter would follow. I ſaid probably; For I ſcarce think that ſuch interpretative guilt reacheth all poſſibilities that are very remote or improbable. I do not think that if a man being ignorant whoſe he was, or of his Maſters affection, had Stolne <hi>Lipſius's</hi> darling Dog<note n="†" place="margin">Which he makes Verſes on. <hi>Lipſy</hi> Epiſt. <hi>Page.</hi> 104. &amp; 294.</note> 
               <hi>Saphirus,</hi> he would have been Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively guilty of Murder, though <hi>Lipſius</hi> had dyed with grief for the Loſs.</p>
            <p>Now if this be true, that that ſort of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency which would excuſe from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if a man did not bring it upon himſelf, would alſo excuſe equally if a man did bring it upon himſelf; then he muſt be very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid that cannot hence ſee, that the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which way one of theſe Impotencies came, and which the other, will neither help nor hinder in the putting an end to the great Controverſies of this Day, nor can be any account why one excuſes, and the other not. Though yet I grant that both the Natural Impotency which will excuſe, and the Moral which will not, came on us from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and our own, and ſo no Reaſon can be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105933:116"/>hence from this conceſſion of one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, and the other not.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2ly.</hi> I have alſo made apparent, that the moral Impotency, or the culpable impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which the Scripture ſpeaks of, come which way it will, doth not excuſe from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Obedience; and that this is no Reaſon why it doth not excuſe, becauſe of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one way or an other, for it is eſſentially culpable and inexcuſable, but the Reaſon is becauſe not-withſtanding this Impotency, a man hath the natural faculty and power to do what he hath this moral Impotency to.</p>
            <p>And indeed let any man conſider it, and he will be as ſure as he can be of any thing. That whatſoever divine command a man hath the natural Power to obey (I mean that the man is no Child, or Fool, that hath not the faculty or ability to know, and chuſe the good, and refuſe the Evil,) ſo that he is no way hindered but by his own wickedneſs (or by that which we call a vitious habit of the Will, be it what it will)) <hi>I</hi> ſay ſuch a man is bound to obey ſuch command, ſo that his wickedneſs though never ſo great will not excuſe him; And this every man is ſure of, however ſome can make a ſhift to puzle themſelves with the undiſtinguiſhed words of can or cannot.</p>
            <p>Take the wickedſt man in the World, that is moſt accuſtomed to do evil, and hath the greateſt averſation of will to good, and ſo one that cannot in the moral Senſe explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105933:116"/>do well, nor obtain of him-ſelf to leave his evil ways without wonderful help from Heaven, yet we are ſure he is bound to leave off his wickedneſs and turn from his ſins, and is blameable in not turning from them this day, that he hath this moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, though God do not ſuch wonderful things for him; And is not only blameable interpretatively, becauſe he made himſelf thus morally Impotent, and brought this wicked averſation of will upon himſelf, but is blameable formally this day in not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and turning to God, becauſe he hath this day the natural Faculty and Power of obeying ſuch commands: For if he had not, but was made by his ſins (as I ſuppoſe ſome have been) a natural Fool, ſo that he had not the natural Power to underſtand and chuſe the good and refuſe the evil, it would not then be his duty this day ſo to obey and turn.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3ly. I</hi> have alſo ſhewed that one ſort of Impotency, the greater it is, the greater is the Fault; and the leſs it is, the leſs is the Fault; in not doing what a man hath the impotency to do; And that the other ſort of Impotency the greater it is, the leſs is the Fault; and the leſs it is, the greater is the Fault; which manifeſteth theſe two kinds of Impotency to be quite different in their own Natures, and that the difference of one excuſing, &amp; the other not, cannot ariſe from one coming one way, and the other another.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:105933:117"/>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> To make this further apparent, if ſuch a thing can be made more apparent, conſider that (which <hi>I</hi> have alſo in part ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of) Chriſt's humane Nature had ſuch an abundant effuſion of the Holy Spirit as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him a morally inſuperable Holy Rectitude of Will; And we are yet ſure notwithſtanding this, that his doing good and eſchewing evil, was morally laudable, becauſe this Holineſs of will did not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his natural Power and Faculty of doing ſinfully, no more than mens morally inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable wickedneſs and everſation of will to good, taketh away their natural Power and Faculty of doing Well. Now we may with as much Reaſon deny the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> deny that Chriſt's Obedience was laudable bcauſe of the Spirits cauſing this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, though he had the natural Power to do otherwiſe, as deny that a man is culpable in not obeying god that hath the natural Power to obey, becauſe of his morally inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable wickedneſs, come this wickedneſs which way it will. Yea, let intelligent men conſider, and they will ſee that if ſome <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaean malum principium</hi> ſhould make a man wicked, juſt as the moſt wicked man now is, though he can give Reaſons why God would not permit this to be, and however not without ſome great Provocation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet ſuch a man though he would not be to blame formally to be ſo made, yet he would be to blame to continue wicked as he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105933:117"/>is, and it would be his fault not to obey God; while he hath, notwithſtanding this wickedneſs, the natural Power to put off ſuch wickedneſs and to obey God; that is, while he is not a natural Fool, that hath not the faculty to know and chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, though a man that will not diſtinguiſh, may puzle and confound his own Notions, and may be puzled by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the words Can, and Cannot; as in ſuch Speeches as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Can a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey without Grace? Can he actually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey without Grace? Can he actually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace obey ſpiritually or acceptably? Can he without Grace actually find in his heart to obey? Which Queſtions are to be anſwered affirmatively while by the word Can is meant the natural Power and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; elſe it would not be men's duty ſo to obey: But ſuch queſtions are to be anſwered negatively when the meaning is, hath he not ſuch a wicked averſation of will as will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hinder him, except Grace overcome it. Now, <hi>I</hi> ſay, though ſuch a man as reſolves to be in the dark by not diſtinguiſhing, may thus be puzled, yet <hi>I</hi> think no man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent abilities can eaſily be puzled, ſo as to be dubious about the ſubſtance of what <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken concerning one impotency ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, and the other not, would he but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when the words Can or Cannot, are objected before him, whether the oppoſers
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105933:118"/>mean by thoſe words, the want of the very natural Faculty and Power or neceſſary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or only a Cannot in reſpect of his being hindred by his wickedneſs or vitious habits.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that what <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken in the Diſcourſe of Natural and Moral Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, can (as <hi>I</hi> there ſaid) ſtand on its own Legs, though <hi>I</hi> ſhould not know how to ſpeak a wiſe word concerning the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul and ſin; And though <hi>I</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the Souls coming <hi>ex traduce</hi> as ſeeming to me the way moſt agreeable to Scripture, and the beſt to anſwer difficulties by; and <hi>I</hi> can almoſt as eaſily puzle my ſelf about the Soul of Beaſts being <hi>ex traduce</hi> as mens; yet my deſign is eſpecially till things <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken, be better conſidered, not to ſpeak ſuch things as may occaſion <hi>differences,</hi> when my deſign is to put an end to them. Nor to give occaſion to any that have a mind to reflect on what I have ſpoken, to run from the queſtion and things well intelligible, to things leſs intelligible, and no way helpfull to decide the important controverſies of free Will, Election, and ſpecial Grace.</p>
